# Contributing to gsoc-orgs

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We value quality, clarity, and collaboration.

## Quick Start

- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch named descriptively: `feature/foo` or `bugfix/bar`.
- Make changes and commit cleanly.
- Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description.

## Code Standards

- Write readable, maintainable code.
- Follow the existing code style.
- Keep PRs small and focused — one logical change per PR.
- Add tests where applicable.

## Reporting Bugs

- Search existing issues first.
- Create an issue with steps to reproduce and expected vs actual results.
- Attach screenshots or logs if possible.

## Feature Requests

- Open an issue proposing the feature.
- Describe use case and motivation clearly.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR:

- Ensure the code builds locally.
- Run lint and fix warnings/errors.
- Rebase/merge latest `main`.
- Provide a clear summary of changes and why they’re needed.

### After Opening a PR

- Respond to review comments in a timely manner.
- Do not force-push without discussion.
- Iterate as needed until the PR is approved.

## Style Guide

- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Avoid unnecessary changes unrelated to the issue/feature.

Thanks for helping improve the project!
