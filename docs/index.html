    <h2>Why gsocorganizationsguide.com exists?</h2>

    <p>
      While preparing for Google Summer of Code, the biggest difficulty was not learning a tech stack or finding organizations.
      It was answering basic but important questions that were spread across many sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions like which organizations select students consistently, which tech stacks are overcrowded,
      whether participation patterns change year by year, and how to realistically shortlist organizations.
      The official GSoC website is excellent for browsing, but it is not designed for analysis.
      Community blogs are helpful, but often opinion-based or outdated.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.gsocorganizationsguide.com" target="_blank">
        gsocorganizationsguide.com
      </a>
      solves this by bringing structure to GSoC data.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analytics and graphs to understand trends clearly</li>
      <li>Year-wise <a href="https://www.gsocorganizationsguide.com/organizations" target="_blank">GSoC organization data</a>  to track long-term participation</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gsocorganizationsguide.com/tech-stack" target="_blank">GSoCTech stack insights</a> to avoid blind competition</li>
      <li>Advanced filters using AND and OR logic for precise shortlisting</li>
      <li>Clean organization pages focused on meaningful signals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is not to tell students what to choose, but to give them clarity to make better decisions.
      Over time, the project will expand with deeper analytics, AI-assisted insights,
      and data-backed blogs focused on real GSoC preparation.
    </p>
