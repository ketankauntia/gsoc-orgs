Currently, omegaUp's public courses are managed manually, which can be time-consuming and lacks community involvement. By using GitHub, contributors can submit pull requests (PRs) to update course content, which will be automatically validated and deployed using GitHub Actions and omegaUp's API.\n\nKey components of the project include:\n1. Course Migration: All public courses will be uploaded to a GitHub repository, structured by course and content type (lectures, problems, etc.).\n2. CI/CD Workflow: A GitHub Actions pipeline will validate and deploy updates when a PR is merged. This pipeline will automatically check for any changes in problems and deploy only the modified content.\n3. API Integration: The system will use omegaUp’s API to upload content after successful review and approval of changes.\n4. Community Collaboration: Contributors can suggest improvements via PRs, with a review process ensuring quality control before deployment.\n5. Automated Testing: The CI/CD pipeline will run validation scripts to check metadata, problem structure, and other course details before deployment.\n6. Security: A review and approval mechanism will prevent unauthorized or malicious content from being deployed.\n\nThe project aims to enhance omegaUp’s educational content by leveraging GitHub’s collaboration model, ensuring faster updates, better quality control, and reduced manual workload for omegaUp staff.\n\nA proof of concept has been set up in a sample GitHub repository, where contributors can simulate the entire workflow by submitting PRs and seeing automatic deployments on omegaUp.\n\nThis approach is expected to streamline course management, making it scalable and more responsive to community-driven improvements.",
