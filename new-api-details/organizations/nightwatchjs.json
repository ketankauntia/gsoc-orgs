          "description": "This project is segmented into four primary categories: Adding Missing Capabilities, Fixing Issues and Enhancements and Adding Examples & Improving Documentation\n\nAdding Missing Capabilities focuses on integrating new commands and aliases into the Element API to fill current gaps, guided by the W3C WebDriver specifications. This includes not only the introduction of additional commands but also the creation of aliases for existing commands to streamline their usability.\n\nFixing Issues and Enhancements involves addressing existing bugs and making improvements to the Element API, such as making action commands chainable, enhancing Selenium integration, and incorporating touch/pen interactions. This section also proposes the addition of new commands based on the feedback and needs identified through user and community engagement.\n\nAdding Examples & Improving Documentation aims to update the existing examples to utilize the New Element API and introduce new examples that demonstrate the API's capabilities through real-life scenarios and automation tasks. Also, improve documentation for usage of the new Element API as well as migrations docs from the old global element API.",

          "description": "@nightwatch/mobile-helper is a tool that allows developers and testers to set up a fully functional Android Emulator environment in just a few minutes, without the need to download the complete Android Studio IDE software. This tool comes in very handy, especially for testers who wish to perform end-to-end tests for their website or native app on Android Emulators, by allowing them to set up everything they need in under 5 minutes, as opposed to having to set up the hefty Android Studio IDE and figuring everything out themselves.This project aims to take this tool one step further, by building on its usability and allowing users to do much more with the tool such that it not only benefits the testers but the developer community as a whole, or anyone who wish to quickly set up Android Emulators on their machines, while only downloading what is necessary, saving both internet bandwidth and storage capacity.\n\nTo achieve this, this project proposes:\n\na) Adding support for wireless adb connection to avoid the inconvenience of using USB cable. Users will be able to connect and manage multiple devices, both real and emulator.\nb) Adding support for downloading and managing multiple system images and emulators to facilitate use of a wider range of emulator devices. \nc) Adding functionality to update the installed SDK tools. \nd) Document all important SDK commands for easy accessibility of the users.\n\nThe tool will help users to perform all these tasks with a very interactive and easy to use command line interface.",
