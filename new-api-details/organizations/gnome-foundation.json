The second plugin gives the user a sense of time, by drawing vertical lines each ten seconds (or other period of time). For example, it will be useful when the user zooms in and wants to move along the timeline, because Pitivi will display guidelines. Finally, the third one is a plugin that avoid the tedious process of dragging video (or image) clips over other video (or image) clips in order to create a transition when there are a very large set of this clips. This plugin will save time to users who just want to import a set of images (of last vacation trip for example) to create a video as fast as possible.</p>\n",

The major problem with supporting all the operations is because of the difference in how POSIX systems handle files whereas how a database-backed system like Google-Drive handles files. This difference results into limitations as to what operations can be performed with the current libgdata API. Since, each file’s identifier is its ID, i.e. “name” equals ID, we have to specifically use “display-name” for storing a file’s title, which is what is shown by nautilus.</p>\n<p>Simply copying/moving files from one folder to other folder results into an error “Operation not supported” so as to preserve the file’s title. Copying/Moving is one of the fundamental operations that should be possible on a file. My ultimate goal with this proposal is to add support for this necessity and make the Google-Drive backend more usable.</p>\n",

Another thing I’ll focus on is the ability to easily add more templates, which could possibly require various changes across the ecosystem. I will be working in close cooperation with the Nautilus developers, GNOME design team, and with various user studies in mind. \nMy main goals are following:\n1. Design and implement an empty state in the New Documents menu, that will offer the user the ability to add new templates, both pre-defined as well as custom.\n2. Making use of visual representations of each template, such as icons, to help users find what they’re looking for.\n3. Add the ability to search the list of templates to add to the menu.",

Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders.\n\n3.

While it already has basic synchronisation functionality, there are missing pieces that need to be developed.\n\nFirst of all, the UI is basic and functionally incomplete; during GSoC 2024 it should reach completeness by implementing an Initial Setup to guide both current and new users through FlatSync's configuration in a simple and user friendly manner.\n\nSecondly, Error Handling should be implemented so that users can be informed of FlatSync's status and act accordingly; this should also simplify the troubleshooting of potential issues by automating their handling as much as possible.\nAn example of this is informing the users of failed syncs or automatically prompting a partial reconfiguration when the authentication token expires.\n\nLastly, Filtering, both on the local machine and globally, should be developed to give users a more granular control over FlatSync’s behaviour; some common cases, such as excluding the Nvidia driver on non-Nvidia machines, should come predefined.\n\nImplementing this would push FlatSync much closer to being ready for a release on Flathub, finally reaching GNOME users.",

This proposal plans to add this support to both the Vala compiler and the Vala API generator. It also seeks to add GI-Docgen format support to Valadoc. I plan to make the Vala compiler support these attributes by making Vala.GIRWriter insert these attributes in the generation of GIR files. Similarly, Vala API generator can support these attributes if  we make Vala.GirParser parse them from GIR files and add them to the Vala AST. Finally, the plan is to make libvaladoc parse comments in the GI-Docgen format. Upon the completion of this project, the Vala compiler and Vala API generator will be able to use these latest attributes in the generation and parsing of GIR files. It will also result in Valadoc being able to support the GI-Docgen documentation format so that it can be used with Vala GIR files. In addition, Valadoc documentation pages will have a modernized appearance and they will be able to render working GI-Docgen links.",
