When an external contributor uploads a patch for a certain issue, the core developer needs to download the patch and then apply the patch and run the tests manually to make sure it works properly. Also, the core developers review the code on the forked version of Rietveld code review tool which is not being maintained. Once the patch is correct, the changes are committed manually. This is a manual and burdensome process for core developers.

It can be workaround by configuring a web server to redirect largefiles request to some other URL, but this solution does not provide sufficient flexibility.\nThe Project goal is to allow user to specify remote server where large files are stored. Instead of downloading all files from the the main repository, client would download them from remote store, which could greatly decrease load from the main server.

Umbrella Sampling (US) is an MD technique which involves performing a series of simulations in which a ‘reaction coordinate’ – such as distance between two molecules – is restrained to different values. Simulation data can be combined, usually using the WHAM method, to produce a ‘potential of mean force’ (PMF) profile that shows the energy landscape along the chosen coordinate. Several implementations of WHAM exist, but require input files of specific formats which may differ from that obtained directly from the simulation, dependent on the simulation engine used. Additionally, it would be convenient be able to calculate the PMF alongside analysis of the trajectory such as offered by MDAnalyisis. However, MDAnalysis does not yet have tools specifically for dealing with and analysing US simulations. This project aims to introduce capabilities for loading US simulation sets, including a generalised tool for loading auxiliary data files, and performing WHAM and other basic analysis.</p>\n",

Prototyping of such models (as large as they may be) needs to be as fast as possible, in order to examine exhaustively many novel ideas as fast as it can be done. For this we need to be able to use with ease as many resources as we have possible. As Theano is contributing to this attempt, current GPU technologies need to be supported extensively in a transient way through its framework. This can be achieved by including optimized operations from current NVidia frameworks, as well as optimizing or designing GPU code which resides in the framework’s backend. Furthermore, analysis and optimization of multi-gpu code, in addition with a consideration of a multi-node/gpu design, would prove themselves useful for this cause.</p>\n",

Implementing coroutines will be the main feature of this project, as this feature offers more new methods than the other features. PEP 465 shows that Matrix multiplication is already used more often than bitwise operations in numeric libraries. Also, having coroutines with async and await syntax as well as enhanced unpacking options, the possibility that Python 3.5 syntax will be used in upcoming code rises. Therefore, an implementation of these features in PyPy3 will definitely increase compatibility to future Python 3 programs. In order to support PyPy’s Python 3 compatibility even further, other new features of Python 3.5 and 3.4 will be implemented after finishing the three PEPs if there is enough time, starting with the enum module of 3.4 and continuing with PEP 461 to allow support of the % formatting operator to bytes and bytearrays.</p>\n",

With Pandas readily available for most users, this is tedious fait accompli for users, since the core data model for PySAL's API was designed before Pandas existed. While newer projects have attempted to extend Pandas for geographic data, those packages have difficult-to-install dependencies that make them inaccessible for many end users, and make design decisions which the author thinks are somewhat suboptimal for PySAL's use case. Therefore, I propose to specify and implement a tabular spatial data model in Python leveraging Pandas dataframes directly, rather than through subclassing. This follows in the spatialite idea that spatial data is first data, then spatial. Thus, tooling must focus on enabling spatial operations directly on Pandas dataframes by exploiting column dtype information and dispatching appropriately, instead of a subclassing approach.

This project proposes to use a more robust and efficient method for automatically denoising diffusion MRI and structural MR datasets, using Local-PCA. Along with an accurate implementation of L-PCA and its adaptation to Rician noise, the project will also aim at optimising the implementation of L-PCA using Cython. \nAfter implementing L-PCA, a method for robust brain extraction needs to be developed. DIPY’s median OTSU based implementation is known not work so well with non-echo planar diffusion imaging (non-EPI dMRI) data. There are few possible ways to improve this, one is to generate labels and have weighted median OTSU. Another idea involves using some version of patch based segmentation using image library constructed from previously annotated images and using it as a reference for the subsequent extraction.</p>\n",

Many more applications are now under investigation such as imaging for cancer (prostate, liver, kidney, pancreas, etc.) and human placenta. One of its largest uses is in brain mapping and neuroscience research such as Parkinson’s disease where it is used to study aging and structural degeneration of fibre pathways in the brain.

It would also entail looking into the possibility of interfacing these device servers to the existing Habitat Monitor and Health Monitor GUI.</li>\n<li>Phase III covers improving the signal quality and, if time allows, performing some signal analysis.

This project aims at porting an updated version of the five-dimensional beamformer to analyze time-frequency data in source space (Dalal et al., 2008; implemented in MNE-Python as “tf_lcmv”). \nThe update adopts the Hilbert transform to obtain a continuous amplitude and phase time series per frequency band, in contrast to the previous method that utilizes discrete time windows and does not retain phase information. It also adds a weight normalization option to the LCMV beamformer (neural activity index and unit noise gain), which will be available for other LCMV versions as well.\nFurthermore, statistical testing of the Hilbert beamformer output using the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be implemented to complete the new Hilbert beamformer pipeline. Due to the size of the MEG data and intensiveness of the calculations, the code will be developed with memory efficiency and parallelization in mind.\nInteractive visualization of source-localized time frequency representations will complete the Hilbert beamformer routine.</p>\n",

For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.\n    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY.</p>\n",

In particular, by determining the strength of the relationship between predictors and response variables, linear regression algorithms can explain variation in the response variable, which can be attributed to variation in the predictors, allowing the identification of variables and/or subsets of data that contain relevant information about the response variable.\nTo date, linear regression functionality in the premier toolbox for analysing neural time series in Python, MNE, is capable of handling designs mostly characterised by the introduction of categorical predictors, to explain variation in brain activity, based on ordinary least squares estimation.\nThe goal of the GSoC project is to extend the functionality and inference options of the linear regression module in MNE-Python by providing a set of functions for specifying and testing more complex variants of the linear regression framework, that are commonly used by the neuroscience community. In addition, the project aims at validating these tools on open data resources.</p>\n",

This project aims to expand the MGWR model to nonlinear local spatial regression modeling techniques where the response outcomes may be discrete (following a Poisson distribution) or binary (Logistic models). Subsequently, to support efficient testing for different model implementations, a simulated data generator module will be implemented to supply test datasets following unique model variable distribution needs. This will also provide a foundation for possible expansion to test other local model implementations in PySAL. Additionally, since the functionality to predict the dependent variable at unsampled locations is not supported for the MGWR model in PySAL, this project also aims to enable predictions for MGWR.</p>\n",

Currently the unumpy library is incomplete as a mirror image of the core NumPy API so I intend to work on expanding its current coverage by adding around 150 function stubs and a JAX backend.</p>\n",

The problem here is that most people do not want to sign in to Gitlab to send an issue and want something faster within the same interface of EOS. The aim of this project is to design a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new icons in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with the request to explain what they want. The admins or EOS maintainers can then resolve, close and revise these requests. Even users can comment and vote for the existing requests. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress.

Another scenario is that the user has a slow network connection at the flight campaign location which is a common problem. Both these situations require a method for the users to be able to make changes to the flight path locally and then be able to compare and merge it with the flight path on the server later.</p>\n<h3>Chat Service Improvements:</h3>\n<p>Improve the communication between users by adding features like - markdown support, ability to send images, searching through messages, ability to delete messages and replying to a specific message.</p>\n<h3>Admin Dashboard:</h3>\n<p>Develop an admin dashboard window to allow mscolab project admins to manage users efficiently, giving them options to add/modify/delete user permissions in bulk.</p>\n",

This in turn requires them to know various file manipulation methods, which are easier to use on linux than on windows. To simplify this process, I propose to create a checker creation helper script, which would take .rpm, .deb, .tar.gz or other files that represent packaged versions of the software to be detected, including the product name and version number that we expect to find in each as a set of inputs.\nThe script would automate the process mentioned in the <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">checkers/readme.md</a></p>\n<p><strong>Recommending Safe Package Versions</strong> -\nCurrently, cve-bin-tool outputs the vulnerable package name, version and vendor-product name. An upgrade to this would be to also provide the user with the list of all safe/fixed packages for the corresponding vulnerable packages found while scanning.\nThis could be done by taking a vulnerable package (which was found in the scan) and web-scraping for the latest vulnerable version and then comparing it with all it’s released versions and then giving the safe version as output.

The implementation in SciPy is too slow to be relied on for practical purposes and custom methods for sampling random variates need to be implemented for the distributions in SciPy.

These recordings are also used to learn about normal brain function under various experimental conditions. The first step in analyzing intracranial electrophysiology recordings is determining the location of the electrode contacts in the coordinate frame of a subject’s T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI). The subject must also have a computed tomography (CT) image taken during or after the implantation surgery. The pre-surgical MRI has better resolution of the brain anatomy than the CT, whereas the CT shows the positions of the electrode contacts. These two 3D images allow the location of the electrode contacts to be associated with anatomical brain structures. MNE-Python has existing tools for analyzing time series data recorded by intracranial electrode contacts but there is a gap in the functionality in being able to label the location of intracranial electrode contacts. The proposed project is to add a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to localize electrode contacts as an enhancement to MNE-Python.</p>\n",

Taking into account all the possible pre-processing strategies, there exists an extremely large number of options and non-experienced users become overwhelmed. A lot of research has been done for providing help and an overview of the different steps of data analysis. The focus, however, has usually been on the model training step, and data pre-processing has generally been overlooked.

This Fourier-transformed sensor data can be used to infer data within the brain in a very similar way as the time-series data but with an added, fifth dimension for frequency. MNE-Python has all the components necessary for time-frequency source estimate viewing and would be greatly improved by integrating them to allow for exploration of this complex data. A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to look at regions of high power spectral density, while letting the user dynamically adjust the range of frequencies, would be incredibly helpful for allowing this kind of data to be explored and analyzed. The ability to browse slices has already been implemented in `mne.gui.ieeg_locate` and could be abstracted to be used in this case. Time-frequency plotting of spectrograms, with appropriate units and baseline correction already exists in MNE-Python as well. Putting these elements together into a GUI would be a great improvement for the MNE-Python tool and community.",

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years.\n\nThis project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to.\n\nSince “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",

Also it should be possible to toggle the active state, so that it is possible to alter data. On toggling a flightpath the data table gets updated.\n\n\n- the server can use categories to filter existing flight paths.

The purpose of this project will be to extend the measures of functional connectivity using a state-space modeling approach utilizing the observed variables (sensor measurements) to estimate functional connectivity across latent variables (neurological regions of interest). The output of this method will provide time-varying autoregressive (AR) coefficients, indicative of the connection strength between any two latent variables. The model’s output will be used to draw a directed graph as a visualization tool to understand information flow across latent variables.

This prevents the substitution of sparse arrays for dense arrays when needed in many data science workflows. PyData/Sparse is a repository that presents an opportunity to address these issues. In order to do so, there needs to be a C++ implementation of a code-generation algorithm that can generate efficient code for any type of sparse tensor operation. This abstraction allows one to maintain a relatively small piece of code that enables functionality for an exponential number of different sparse array format operations. The main objective of the project is to implement, test and document the merge lattice and its related data structures and algorithms that are vital for code-generation. This will result in a generalizable code-generation algorithm that can be applied for implementing a variety of different sparse ndarray formats that work together. This will involve interfacing heavily with the existing C++ code and its implemented templates to add functionality that constructs and manipulates a merge lattice, which is a useful abstraction in code-generation for sparse tensor algebra operations. As a few stretch goals, I plan on: i) implementing abstractions of what a sparse array is and what operations can be done that leverage this underlying core API, ii) finishing the co-iteration algorithm to account for non-unique and non-ordered levels and iii) begin work on the actual code-generation algorithm that leverages the merge lattice.",

For Python backend, we can simply use SymPy itself.\n\nThe algorithms would be implemented in the ASR code, which would make them independent of any specific frontend. Any frontend that uses the ASR code could then make use of the symbolic algorithms without having to reimplement them. LPython, in this case, would not implement the symbolic algorithms themselves, but would instead parse the syntax used by the SymPy library, which already has a rich set of symbolic algorithms, and use the ASR representation of these expressions to perform various operations.

These improvements will help users more efficiently and effectively manage their backups, improve testing processes, and facilitate disaster recovery.\n\nFirstly, I will implement a search function that allows users to filter files by search string in Vorta's diff and extract view. I will also add the \"Change\" filter to the comparison view, which will filter only removed, added, and modified files. This task also includes adding syntax to allow advanced filtering and filter by size range as a stretch goal. These enhancements will help users easily find and manage their backup files.\n\nSecondly, I will improve BorgBackup testing by implementing live binary tests in Vorta. Currently Vorta contains stdout and stderr mock files for the Borg JSON output of various commands for testing purposes but there’s no actual running of the commands. Moreover, it only supports one mock file while Vorta supports multiple Borg versions where output syntax may vary.\n\nThis project aims to improve Vorta Testing by implementing live binary tests that run on multiple actual Borg versions/binaries. I'll also integrate live binary tests with Vorta's CI/CD pipeline. \n\nFinally, I will implement bootstrap functionality in Borgmatic to restore backups from nothing, enabling users to easily recover their data in the event of a disaster. I will implement this feature by providing clear and comprehensive documentation, which will outline the steps required to perform a Borgmatic restore from scratch. This will significantly improve disaster recovery capabilities and reduce the risk of data loss.",

Studies of visual perception and attention in particular are increasingly integrating eye-tracking and EEG/MEG devices, in order to gain a better understanding of these processes and their neural correlates. However, the Python community has yet to coalesce around a well-supported package for analyzing eye-tracking signals. \n\nThis project proposes to integrate support for reading, visualizing, and analyzing eye-tracking signals in MNE-Python.  By incorporating the ability to analyze eye-tracking data into MNE-Python, researchers would be able to analyze both neural and eye movement data within the same software environment, making MNE-Python more versatile and useful for a wider range of research questions. Finally, MNE-Python has a large community of developers and users, making it likely that eye-tracking integration will prove useful for many in the scientific Python community.\n\nThis project will focus on building a robust I/O routine for eye-tracking data and developing functions for preprocessing, visualization, and analytical routines that are commonly required in eye-tracking research. This includes the ability to interpolate eye-position data during blinks, produce heatmap plots of eye-position across trials, and estimate the deconvolved pupil response.",

The goal of this project is to modernize the GUI using the Pyfilesystem module to make it more user-friendly and efficient.\nPyfilesystem is a Python module used for accessing different types of file systems. It provides a common API for working with various file systems, such as local, remote, and cloud-based storage systems. The Pyfilesystem module is easy to use and has many features that can be used to improve the functionality of the fs_filepicker.\n\nView Layout and Restoring::\nThe mscolab project is a collaborative software platform that enables multiple users to work together on a shared project in real-time. The project is written in Python and uses the PyQT GUI library for the user interface. Currently, the PyQT Gui of the MSS client can handle different views by one flight path. However, once a new flight path is loaded and activated, all views change to this flight path. This is inconvenient for users who want to work on multiple flight paths simultaneously. Additionally, the view configuration consists of many windows with a complex set of configuration options that are tedious to re-create after shutting down the application.\nThis proposal aims to improve the mscolab user interface by adding the ability to store and restore the view configuration of multiple windows for the user. Additionally, the proposal seeks to add a layout option for any participant on the same flight path, as well as the ability for the creator of an operation to set the layout of all participants.",

Additionally, current testing files need more a consistent file structure and organization.\n\nSolution: Work with organization mentors to prioritize test code coverage. Create unit and integration tests to reach our target code coverage. Reorganize and restructure testing file.\n\nDeliverables: At least 80% code coverage, with a stretch goal of 85%. Test files separated into unit tests vs integration tests. Consistency in file naming and structure across all test files.\n\nProject 2) Implement Profile Sidebar\n\nProblem: The current profile selector and setting tab implementation mixes global setting with profile specific settings. \n\nSolution: Move the profile selector and settings button to a collapsible sidebar. The settings button opens a new interface with options relating to global settings and profile management, while the individual profile buttons open to profile specific settings.\n\nDeliverables: A new sidebar with profile selector and setting button, as well as a new setting interface. Unit and integration testing accompanying all new features.\n\nProject 3: Test on Live Borg Binary\n\nProblem: Currently we test on static mock files of Borg JSON output. This task would improve testing to run on actual Borg versions/binaries.\n\nSolution: Test multiple versions of Borg using Tox to simplify testing. Implement these changes in setup.cfg\n\nDeliverables: CICD running tests on live Borg binaries with > 99% success rate. Include the option to run existing integration tests locally.

Opinion dynamics models are often simple, yet understanding patterns in potentially high-dimensional opinion spaces is a significant task. Therefore, this project aims to bridge the gap between simple toy models and complex real-world issues. Hari-Plotter is based on NetworkX to handle graphs, with several classes to handle simulations and run data. During the Google Summer of Code, I will work on handling multi-dimensional opinions, different agent types encoding various behavioral patterns and clustering opinions, and I will add functionality for averaging data over multiple simulation runs. In addition, I plan to work on adding documentation to make Hari-Plotter more user-friendly and accessible.",

MNE-Connectivity leverages the API of the highly-popular MNE-Python signal processing package to provide tools for computing such connectivity. However, given the complexities associated with studying interactions in the brain, it is critical that the metrics for estimating connectivity are robust, and the estimates themselves statistically significant. Naturally, it is essential that such tools are available in open-source toolboxes, something we will address in this project. First, building on recent work in the MNE-Connectivity toolbox, we will implement further support for advanced multivariate connectivity metrics in the form of a dedicated decoding module. This module will provide flexible tools for the data-driven analysis of connectivity that is critical for robust characterisations of network activity in multi-channel recordings. The only comparable implementations of such methods are in toolboxes for the proprietary language MATLAB, limiting the availability of these tools to the wider research community. Second, we will expand the existing set of statistical features available in MNE-Python to include tools for assessing the statistical significance of estimated connectivity, crucial for distinguishing genuine interactions from background noise. In all cases, new features will be complemented with detailed examples and tutorials in the MNE-Connectivity documentation. Altogether, the project will expand the repertoire and quality of open-source tools available for studying connectivity in the brain, a cornerstone of modern neurophysiological research.",

Based on recent guidance by the OpenSSF an effort has been made to look into implementing hardened compiler options for CPython. The phases of this project include establishing benchmarks for existing performance with current compiler options as well as the counts and types of errors. Some work has been done so far to evaluate warnings when compiling with the TL;DR compiler options provided by OpenSSF, but more research should be done to establish candidate flags. Secondly performance analysis should be generated for candidate compiler flags. Warnings should be combed for false positives since this can impact if the work should be undertaken to fix these warnings or not use the compiler flag. Once compiler options have been selected in accordance with desired safety goals, performance analysis, and additional work needed to address warnings then tooling should be implemented to track new violations relative to an existing baseline.",

Inspired by pybind11, this project aims to implement a compatible binding solution for pocketpy. By utilizing the template metaprogramming technique in C++17, we can extract metadata from C++ classes and functions and generate wrapper code automatically. By the end of this summer, header files compatible with pybind11 will be implemented for pocketpy. Existing pybind11 users can seamlessly migrate their bindings into pocketpy. New users can also benefit from this high-level binding solution.

Alongside the disassembled machine instructions in the dashboard, there would be text to indicate the action that each instruction takes, such as moving values between CPU registers, writing data to memory, or doing a mathematical operation. We would resolve the concrete values that memory and CPU registers take on after each instruction, providing relevant information that the user would otherwise have to fish out manually using a GDB command that varies depending on the context.\n\nPwndbg is starting to support this annotation feature for the x86 architecture. My project would add these annotations to other architectures supported by Pwndbg, namely 32-bit Arm, 64-bit Arm, RISC-V, and MIPS. This not only aids in debugging and reverse engineering, as you would gain much-needed context as to the results of instructions, but there is also an educational benefit in that you can visually see what each instruction is doing while stepping through a binary.\n\nWe would additionally create annotations for future instructions in the disassembly view using emulation. By combining the Unicorn Engine, a CPU emulator framework, with the Capstone Engine, a disassembly framework, we can provide the user with insight into the next handful of instructions, providing more context and increasing debugging efficiency. \n\nDeliverable\n- A series of pull requests which add annotations for instructions for Arm, AArch64, RISC-V, and MIPS inside the “disassembly” view of the Pwndbg dashboard\n- A rewrite of the parent class API to make adding annotations to new architectures more simple\n- Add the ability for the recursive printing of pointers inside the annotations to provide enhanced information on pointers inside heap memory, such as internal heap manager metadata\n- Documentation and tests to aid future contributors and reduce chance of regressions",

Additionally, collaborative operations do not support sharing view configurations among participants, hindering real-time coordination.\n\nTo enhance the user experience and collaboration in the Mission Support System (MSS), this project will introduce two major improvements. First, it will implement a local and server-side view restoration system, allowing users to save and reload their window layouts automatically. This will be achieved through JSON-based storage for local configurations and database integration for server-side persistence. Users will have the option to enable or disable view restoration via a new setting, ensuring flexibility.\nSecond, the project will introduce a collaborative view-sharing feature through a dedicated \"Manage View\" widget. This will enable participants in an operation to share, browse, and load predefined layouts, ensuring consistency during joint missions. The widget will integrate with MSS’s existing operation system, allowing real-time updates via WebSocket notifications. Backend APIs will handle secure storage and retrieval of shared views, while the frontend will provide an intuitive interface for managing layouts.\n\nTogether, these enhancements will eliminate the need for manual reconfiguration and streamline teamwork in mission planning and analysis.",

Currently, Tölvera's reliance on Python coding presents a barrier for those without programming expertise. This project will refine and substantially extend tv.llm, a functional proof-of-concept NLI module, enabling users to generate and modify Tölvera sketches using natural language commands. The core work of this project involves expanding the NLI's architecture, which utilizes Pydantic for configuration validation and Jinja2 for reliable code generation, to encompass a broader range of Tölvera modules (tv.vera, tv.osc, tv.cv, tv.mp, tv.iml), refining prompt engineering strategies, and improving the command-line interface. Deliverables will include the full release of the tv.llm module integrated as a core Tölvera feature, detailed documentation, and an evaluation report.  The goal is to help empower a broader community of users to integrate Tölvera into their creative workflows.",

First, I’ll update the Ansible role to support the latest Borgmatic config format (post-1.8.0), which includes adding a new config template, wrapping new v2.0.0 options, and verifying applied configs. Second, I’ll implement directory format support for MySQL and MariaDB, similar to how PostgreSQL does it, allowing faster backups and more flexible restores. Third, I plan to add native support for Docker and Podman container volume backups using their sockets, so users don’t have to write custom scripts. This includes designing the config schema, implementing backup/restore hooks, and updating tests and docs.",

          "description": "The project involves integrating pixel size support into ilastik, an image-processing and classification tool. Pixel size is a metadata item enabling conversion of image pixels into real-world measurements. \nWhilst pixel size is not currently processed in ilastik image sets, the program is used extensively in scientific applications, and introducing real-world measurements would enable development of several key features that would allow more in-depth quantitative analysis of image data, such as object displacement and velocity in video tracking, and real-world area calculation of segmentations/ volume calculation of carvings.\n\nOnce the metadata is extracted at the image input end, it is possible to feed it directly into the data pipeline, so it can be picked back up within any relevant workflow. This facilitates feature development, as it then becomes possible to work directly with the metadata values within the workflow. Once the backends of these features have been developed, they will be implemented on the front-end via Qt.\n\nThe key deliverables of this project are:\n Implement pixel size metadata into workflows, such that the metadata remains present in project files, output images, and exported datasets; \nEnable calculating areas of image segmentations; \nEnable calculating volumes of image carvings; \nEnable recording of object displacement in video tracking; \nEnable measurement of object velocity in video tracking; \nProduce detailed and well-written documentation, and ensure  relevant test scripts for each feature are made available.

However, it currently lacks comprehensive support for several underrepresented countries, which limits its utility for users seeking to understand global holiday practices. This proposal aims to enhance the framework by integrating holiday data for 12 additional countries: Fiji, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Comoros, Ivory Coast, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Eritrea.\n\nTo achieve this, I will conduct thorough research to gather accurate holiday data from authoritative governmental sources, ensuring linguistic accuracy through credible translations. The integration process will involve developing a structured approach to accommodate both fixed and floating holidays, as well as regional variations. I will leverage my previous contributions to the framework, particularly my work on Fiji, as a foundation for this project.\n\nThe deliverables for this project will include:\n\n -  Integrated holiday data for the 12 new countries within the Open World Holidays Framework.\n -  Comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the accuracy and compatibility of the newly added data.\n -  Updated documentation that reflects the new country support and provides clear usage instructions for users.\n\nBy expanding the framework's coverage, this project will not only enhance its functionality but also promote cultural awareness and inclusivity, making it a valuable resource for users worldwide.",

Vorta provides a user-friendly desktop GUI for Borg, while Borgmatic serves as a command-line interface for managing backups. This proposal outlines four projects designed to improve the functionality, security, and usability of both Vorta and Borgmatic. \n\nFor the first project aims to add a new feature to the Vorta GUI that lets users change their repository passphrase. Changing a Borg repository passphrase is a feature that’s often requested but hasn’t been fully implemented yet within Vorta.  This would make security management more accessible and eliminate the need for users to use Borg directly for such tasks. \n\nThe second project aims to develop a custom file selector with PyQt6 FileDialog, which will handle multiple file and directory selections in one window. At the moment, Vorta has separate dialogs for selecting files and directories. This allows users to select both files and directories in a single window.\n\nThe third project aims to introduce a much-needed improvement by adding a file selector dialog that allows users to pick files and directories to exclude directly through the UI. Right now, users who want to exclude certain files or directories from their backup have to manually type in paths or use patterns. This will allow users to eliminate the need for manual match expressions and reducing errors. \n\nThe final project aims on wrapping a few missing Borg subcommands into Borgmatic actions, so users can perform these tasks directly through Borgmatic without needing to use Borg’s CLI. These additions will make Borgmatic more comprehensive, \nreducing the need for users to jump between tools to perform essential tasks.\n\nThese enhancements will make Vorta and Borgmatic user-friendly and feature-complete, ultimately improving the quality of backup process for users across different platforms.",
