I would like to contribute to the idea of <strong>Virtual Room</strong> this summers and be a part of the community. Recently I have been involved with a lot of real time applications .The hidden motivation behind choosing this project is mainly due to an application I recently developed, Latch for a hackathon. It is a Location based chat application, using Django as the primary backend server and Node.js for real time data handling. I already had an idea of developing a similar video based application which introduced me to WebRTC. I saw this project of Virtual Room in P2PSP, and the idea of an open source real time video streaming application fascinated me a lot. I believe that it could be very useful and can create an impact on the community.</p>\n",

As P2PSP core implementation is in C++ which is quite fast, but making any changes can be quite challenging. Making a simulator would help us to visualize any changes made in algorithms and protocols. If we can replace Unix sockets with internet socket, then it will become quite easier to make changes in actual production code.</li>\n<li><strong>Use of pyqtgraph library as an alternative to matplotlib</strong>. Use of matplotlib for real-time plotting is such a mess. PyQtGraph could be a very good alternative for all the plotting purposes. As main motive of pyqtgraph library is to enhancing the speed for real-time plotting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project would be a milestone for other production projects.
