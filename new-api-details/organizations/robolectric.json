Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt.\n\nAs it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt.\n\nThe Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. \n \nConscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. \n\nConscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code. But BoringSSL doesn't have official releases and makes no guarantees around API or ABI stability.",

However, this advanced modularization introduces complexities in local testing environments, particularly with tools like Robolectric that are critical for unit testing Android applications.\n\nThis project aims to extend Robolectric's testing capabilities to fully support dynamic feature modules and the AAB publishing format, addressing the current limitations in activity launching, resource loading, and environment setup for testing apps that utilize dynamic feature delivery and on-demand feature modules.",
