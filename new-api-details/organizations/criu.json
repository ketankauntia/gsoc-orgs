Primary issue is bloat of irreclaimable memory due to pipe-pages. Pipe buffers are pinned in memory making them non swappable. Pipes have maximum size restriction, so there could be many pipes which results in memory pressure during pre-dump process. Replacing pipe-pages with userspace supplied buffer from CRIU will alleviate this memory pressure. Since, the buffer pages can be swapped out.</p>\n<p>Another issue is duration for which pre-dump algorithm freezes the target task. Use case like live migration expects smallest possible freezing glitch. So, objective is to reduce this freeze time during pre-dump.</p>\n<p>To achieve both of these objectives, we use process_vm_readv system call with a set of VMA-list gathered by freezing target task for minimal amount of time. There are challenges in handling memory areas with this approach, like race conditions resulting in false reads. Development of graceful solution for these challenges is objective of this project.</p>\n",

In order for CRIU to support the UDP_CORK socket option, we need to read back the data in the UDP socket send queue at the checkpoint, and restore the send queue data along with the UDP_CORK socket option to the new UDP socket at the restore. In order to implement reading back UDP socket send queues, we need to find a way to extend the Linux kernel that is accepted by the kernel community.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal I proposed 6 technical paths that can be used to implement dumping of UDP socket send queue and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages, including an innovative approach to dumping kernel information using eBPF.",

These policies will enable users to efficiently manage checkpoint resources, preventing operational challenges and resource exhaustion.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nCurrent container checkpoint management lacks advanced and flexible garbage collection policies. This results in operational inefficiencies and resource wastage.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nEnhance the existing Kubernetes operator with advanced garbage collection policies. These policies will empower users to define how checkpoints are managed at different levels (global, per-namespace, per-pod, per-container), ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing operational challenges.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n\nGarbage Collection Policies:\n1. Implement dynamic checkpoint threshold policy for fine-grained control over checkpoint management.\n2. Introduce orphaned checkpoint cleanup policy to remove obsolete checkpoints.\n3. Implement time-based checkpoint retention policy for automatic deletion of outdated checkpoints.\n\nAutomated Checkpoint Management (Optional):\n1. Automate checkpoint lifecycle management, including creation, replacement, and deletion.\n2. Enforce storage quotas and monitor storage utilization.\n3. Collect metrics, enable alerting, and implement event logging for proactive management.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe implementation of these garbage collection policies will enable users to manage different container's(pod's, namespace's) checkpoint with different garbage collection policies. It will optimize resource utilization, and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nNote: Optional functionalities such as automated checkpoint management will be considered based on available time and project priorities.",

While Kubernetes has recently introduced checkpointing support, it lacks a proper synchronization mechanism for distributed workloads, especially in managing network state during checkpoint and restore.\n\nTo solve this, the project proposes to extend the existing criu-coordinator tool with support for network connection management via CRIU’s hook mechanisms. The work will involve implementing network-lock and network-unlock hooks, developing a pod-level network locking mechanism, and differentiating between internal and external TCP connections during checkpointing.",

The project leverages recent upstream additions to glibc and Linux kernel that enable GCS support in user space, using Yocto and Arm's Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) to emulate and test the architecture-specific functionality. This is a first step in exploring how CRIU might need to change to handle GCS systems, starting with test coverage\n\nProject Deliverables \nJune 2 (coding begins) - GCS-enabled Environment Verified. Yocto + FVP setup is confirmed working. Compiling and running GCS-marked binaries with glibc tunables active.\nJuly 12-16 (Midterm Evaluation) - First GCS ZDTM test added. A basic test that reads verifies TPIDR2_EL0, and explores stack/register consistency across the restore boundary. Integration with --nocr working. Investigation of parasite.c and restorer.c to identify the point at which TLS or control state (e.g., TPIDR2_EL0) could be saved or restored.\nAugust 16-August 23 (Final Evaluation) - Full round-trip test of checkpointing and restoring a GCS-using process. All tunables, toolchain flags, and kernel glibc dependencies documented.\nAugust 31 (Final Results Announced) - Final cleanup and documentation. Tutorial-style instructions provided on how to replicate setup, test flow, and next steps.\nPost GSOC - I will remain available to  support further maintenance, and help  any future contributors pick up.",
