This would enhance healthcare data exchange due to the better performance of protocol buffers. It would also allow HAPI commands to run on data stored in FHIR protos. Sample code that would demonstrate the use of this library to execute Clinical Quality Language Using HAPI against FHIR protos will also be included.</p>\n",

This is important for healthcare interoperability, as it is necessary to have fast navigation, selection and formulation of invariants in both Fast Healthcare Interoperability resources and HL7 Clinical Query language.
