Currently, a build can be started only when patches are committed to the master branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has led to some major setbacks with respect to developer productivity. MacPorts also needs some custom views in buildbot to be able to better analyze build history, commits, etc. The legacy version doesn’t allow us to write such custom views.
