This project involves making a set of reusable utility functions for going through different types of StreamField structures and applying changes, as well as ready made high level functions for common use cases of StreamField related data migrations and a way to generate corresponding migration files.

StreamField Block for Images: I will create a new block specifically for images that includes an alt text field. This ensures editors don't forget to add alt text.\n(2). Modifying the Image Model: I will add an \"image description\" field to the existing image model. This provides more flexibility for alt text.\n(3). Writing tests.\n(4). Updating documentation.\n(5). Exploring the use of AI to generate alt text suggestions (as a stretch goal, along with some other stretch goals in the PDF I attached).\n\nI plan to achieve the first two goals by building upon the pertinent Pull Requests I have already drafted at the time of writing this. Goals 3 and 4 will follow each of the first two goals closely, and I have commenced research on integrating AI models with inspiration from the Wagtail-AI GitHub repository. For goal 5, I plan on working hand in hand with the A11y team.\n\nThis project will make Wagtail sites more accessible for visually impaired users and improve overall accessibility compliance.",
