While LLD is regarded as a faster alternative to system linkers, the new mold linker has shown that there are still speed gains to be had. My work will include bringing parallelism to the construction of various linker-synthesized sections in the Mach-O port, and to input file reading.

WebAssembly is especially popular for web games and other performance-oriented applications.

Currently, the mentors are working on WasmFS, an emulated file system built in C++/WebAssembly, for Emscripten. However, WasmFS lacks the JavaScript required to connect the existing JS API to the new C++/WebAssembly file system operations. \r\n\r\nThe central goal of this project is to build a new JavaScript library modeled after Emscripten’s existing file system library that will call WasmFS functions instead of JavaScript routines. This approach aims to speed up filesystem operations and lay the foundation to add multithreading in the future. That being said, this project does not aim to redesign the filesystem implementation for Emscripten. This project also will not add new functionality to the Emscripten file system. Finally, this project will not attempt to add full multithreading functionality yet.",

This reduces developer time spent on waiting for rebuilds and the new features improve program load times.\n\nWhile LLD is generally considered fast – especially compared to Apple’s older linker – the mold project has shown that significant speedups are possible. By processing input files in parallel, we can eliminate the biggest bottleneck. A faster SHA256 implementation will aid in computing code signatures. I will also focus on fixing the last problems preventing chained fixups from being enabled by default. Lastly, if time permits, I’m interested in improving Clang warnings.",

This will involve retaining drag-and-drop functionality for bookmark organization within the tree view, ensuring compatibility with screen readers, and conducting comprehensive testing for usability and accessibility.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n1. Implement tree view functionality in the bookmarks side panel, allowing users to view all bookmarks at once.\n2. Update existing drag and drop functionality for organizing bookmarks within the tree view.\n3. Ensure accessibility standards are met, focusing on tab traversal and screen reader support.\n4.

However, INP lacks granularity, making it difficult for developers to diagnose and address specific latency issues within different stages of event processing and rendering.\n\nSolution Approach:\nTo enhance the diagnostic capabilities of INP, this proposal suggests breaking down the INP metric into its sub-dimensions—input delay, processing time, and presentation delay—by leveraging modifications to Chromium’s Event Timing API. These fine-grained timestamps will be transmitted from the Renderer process to the Browser process via Mojo IPC, eventually integrating these metrics into the UKM metric system and CrUX experimental dataset. The project will involve updating the PageLoadMetricsSender to include detailed timing data for each event, as well as enhancing the UkmPageLoadMetricsObserver to handle both old and new data formats seamlessly.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n1. Prototype Verification: Establish a proof-of-concept for collecting sub-dimension data using Chromium’s debugging environment.\n2. Mojo Protocol Modification: Extend existing IPC interfaces to support new subpart timings.\n3. UKM Integration: Implement new UKM metrics reporting and update relevant configurations.\n4. Test Suite Development: Develop comprehensive tests including Web Platform Tests/WPT cases and unit test coverage.\n5. Performance Regression Testing: Analyze benchmark reports and memory usage to ensure no negative impact on performance.\n6. Documentation & Wrap-up: Provide detailed design documentation and outline plans for integrating improvements into CrUX.",

Currently, there are some units which might be missing coverage across the web platform test repository and the Chromium build. Our aim is to implement new tests for better coverage and reduce flakiness. Making better tests will reduce that ambiguity and ensure the proper working of the FedCM API. In the process of completing this project, a 100% green dashboard on wpt.fyi will further solidify the standard of tests developed and fixed for the Chromium browser family,\n\nTest Coverage: Comparing the Federated Credential Management API tests with the test suite provided by both, the Chromium project and the Web Platform Tests. Includes compilation of currently untested units.\n\nTest Migration: Migrating internal Chromium tests to external/wpt benefits cross-browser compatibility and standardization. This means adhering to the standard set by WPT and working on clearing all the errors for Chrome on the wpt.fyi dashboard. Another benefit is that Chromium based browsers can use migrated tests instead of starting from scratch while developing tests compatible with their browser.\n\nNew Tests: Writing WPT compatible tests in HTML, JavaScript and Python. It will simulate user actions while interacting with Federated Credential Management flows. This includes all the errors which may be caused due to some unprecedented user action, or edge cases where the Identity Provider faces trouble while sending tokens to the Relying Party. Simulating such scenarios will help provide better coverage and make better tests. Another idea would be communicating with people who faced issues regarding the FedCM API in the Chromium community.\n\nReduction of Flakiness: Reducing test flakiness is essential to increase trust in the test suites provided by Chromium and can be done by categorizing whether a flaky test should be removed entirely, flagged as platform-specific error, or by modifying the Test Expectation file.",

          "description": "This project focuses on improving the testing system for web audio features in Chromium—the open-source engine behind browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and others. Currently, over 300 audio-related test files rely on an old helper library called audit.js. While useful in the past, this library is now outdated and duplicates many features already provided by the more modern and standardized W3C testing framework, testharness.js.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to modernize these tests by replacing audit.js with testharness.js, which is better supported and more efficient. I will also create a lightweight audio-specific helper tool to ensure that any necessary features from the old library are preserved. This work involves JavaScript debugging, writing clean and maintainable test code, and aligning with W3C standards.\r\n\r\nBy streamlining and modernizing Chromium’s web audio tests, this project will improve testing efficiency and reduce technical debt in one of the most widely used browser engines in the world. The impact will extend to millions of users across browsers that rely on Chromium—improving performance, stability, and long-term maintainability of web audio features on the open web.",

This tool will allow developers, QA engineers, and ChromeOS/Android teams to debug and test printing workflows without requiring physical printer hardware.\n\nThe app will function as an IPP-compatible printer on the network, responding to print jobs, processing documents, and allowing users to configure printer capabilities by uploading or directly retrieving IPP attributes from real printers. It will also support advanced features like print job simulation, plugin-based behavior injection, and exportable logs for deep debugging.\n\nThis virtual printer will empower developers to reproduce and fix complex bugs, simulate diverse printer setups, and even integrate testing in CI pipelines — all through a user-friendly Android app. By combining protocol-level accuracy with intuitive design, it offers a powerful emulation environment for printer-related development and troubleshooting.",
