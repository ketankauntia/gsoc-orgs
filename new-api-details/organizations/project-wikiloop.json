Knowledge Graphs pull in data from a variety of sources such as Wikidata. This data is used to understand user search intent and to answer search queries. The project will focus on importing data of places and persons from BDRC database, as well as the addition of new data on existing Wikidata records from BDRC. All the shortcomings present in the database will be dealt with and improved.</p>\n<p>Upon successful completion of this project: The Tibetan community members will be able to get better search results.
