With the introduction of Functional Components, a new approach of Hooks was introduced, which makes code clean and more efficient in use. The idea is to migrate components to functions &amp; hooks, tests to React Native Testing Library, and use of the latest APIs of React Native, including Pressable &amp; Animated API</p>\n",
