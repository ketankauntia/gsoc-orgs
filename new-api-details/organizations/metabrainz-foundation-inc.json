          "description": "A smooth and intuitive onboarding experience is essential for any app, ensuring that users understand its features while maintaining trust and engagement. This project focuses on enhancing the ListenBrainz Android onboarding flow by making it more informative, user-friendly, and privacy-conscious. Key improvements include a dedicated Listen Submission screen to give users full control over which apps contribute listens, clear permission rationales, and fallback mechanisms for denied permissions. Additionally, a revamped sign-in screen will provide better navigation, including a bug report option for easy issue submission.  \n\nThese improvements are crucial for user transparency and trust. By introducing a Listen Submission screen, users can choose how and when their listening data is collected, ensuring privacy and control. Clear permission rationales and fallback handling prevent confusion and provide users with alternative ways to grant necessary permissions. The addition of update prompts and options like disabling battery optimization in settings ensures users stay updated with the latest features and optimizations effortlessly.  \n\nSeamless updates and proactive issue resolution enhance the overall experience. Integrating an update prompt for Play Store and F-Droid users keeps them informed about new releases, while a \"Report Bug\" button on the sign-in screen streamlines feedback collection. These refinements will significantly improve user retention, ensuring ListenBrainz remains a top choice for tracking listening habits while prioritizing privacy and usability.",

Apache Spark will handle efficient data processing and aggregation. These visualizations will offer granular insights into genre trends, artist diversity, and temporal listening patterns, enhancing user experience and engagement.\n\nThe project will result in the development and integration of the following four interactive charts into ListenBrainz:  \n\n1. Generate Artist Listening Activity Statistics: A function to calculate the number of listens for each artist over a specified time range, mapping the data into an interactive visualization that shows the evolution of artists a user listens to over time.  \n\n2. Generate Listens by Era Statistics: A function to calculate the number of listens grouped by the year of release of each track, producing a chart that displays listens by era, enabling users to explore the distribution of their music preferences across different periods.  \n\n3. Genre-Based Listening Patterns: A dynamic visualization that tracks a user’s engagement with different genres over time, highlighting how their music preferences evolve. It will also analyze trends in genres listened to at different times of day, revealing how mood or activity influences music choices.  \n\n4. Top Listeners: A leaderboard-style visualization that tracks and highlights the top listeners sitewide. This chart will showcase the most active users and display who listens the most within their social circles, encouraging community engagement and fostering a sense of connection among users.  \n\nThese interactive charts will enhance the ListenBrainz user experience by providing deeper insights into listening habits and fostering a stronger sense of community.",
