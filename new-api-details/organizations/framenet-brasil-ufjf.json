          "description": "<p>Machine Translation is one of the most essential tasks of Natural Language Processing where a lot of research has been done. There are various metrics that are available to evaluate the quality of translation but most are obtained by computing the similarity between an MT hypothesis and a reference translation based on character N-grams or word N-grams. Using the data generated from the annotation of the TED Talk in two or more languages, as well as the relations between frames given in the Berkeley FrameNet Data Release 1.7, our task for this project is to build an automated metric system for machine translation, which is intended to measure the frame distance between sentence pairs in two languages. In this proposal, the task has been modelled as a regression task of predicting accuracy scores. The frames evoked and the related frame network has been used as pivotal features of the model.</p>\n",

First, before the GSoC 2020 starts, I intend to complete a Python API for retrieving the annotation dataset. Throughout the GSoC 2020, I will modify existing parsers and create neural networks to project semantic frames and frame elements to unannotated sentences. I mainly work with projections on the manually aligned sentences and aligned sentences generated through transitivity. In addition to suggesting techniques for tackling m:n alignment, I also propose metrics for evaluating the projections in binary and graded manners as well as a phraseological method for analyzing projections for metaphorical phrases. If time permits, I would create sentence alignment models for aligning EN-JP, EN-FR, EN-UR, and EN-HI sentences.</p>\n",

In order to annotate multimodal corpora, individual frames or ideas depicted within the video need to be extracted using corresponding audio transcriptions and identified objects. This is important to obtain fine grained semantic representations of events and entities. Moreover, the video may be presented in multiple languages that need to be detected and translated to Portuguese. Also individual objects within a video need to be tracked and identified to generate corresponding textual frame elements that can speed up the annotation process.</p>\n",
