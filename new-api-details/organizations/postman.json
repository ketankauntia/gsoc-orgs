          "description": "The world of JSON Schema is immense. JSON Schema tooling exists in countless languages across a variety of uses (data validation of course a noteworthy and prominent one). Implementing the JSON Schema specification(s) in a fully compliant way is not without challenge, meaning as a user of JSON Schema it is important to understand how a particular implementation may deviate such that one can make constructive tooling choices or help implementations improve. Bowtie is a recently created tool to aide in this task, helping to surface the conformance of various JSON Schema tools with the specification by running them against a set of known correct test cases and regularly rendering the results to a web page. But it can do more!\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nEnhance (or replace) Bowtie's simplistic current UI so that it most easily answers \"what do various implementations say about each test case\" -- making it snappier and more featureful\nAdd support for further JSON Schema implementations by creating Bowtie harnesses in additional languages\nTeach Bowtie to compare not only True/False validation results but also the full JSON Schema standardized output formats",

The TLDR; is the solution that should function like a search engine for OpenAPI definitions.\nThe proposal addresses the issue that the open-source strategy is attempting to address: finding Swagger and OpenAPI definitions on the open web, crawling websites, and common crawl for API definitions, validating them, and then consuming and indexing them for an ongoing search. The goal is to make it easier for developers to discover APIs by searching for documentation, repositories, and other common aspects of operating an API. This is part of an initiative called API First World Approach, which allows developers to easily discover APIs.",
