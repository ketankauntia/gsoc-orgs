Creating an open source tool to do this will aid these projects in generating accurate SBOM information at release time. This tool should be implemented as a command line, so it can be incorporated into builds, and options can be added.

The project proposes adding features such as automatic creation of pull requests and .txt test files, improving error handling, adding unit tests and GitHub API interaction tests with mock, and creating a base reusable Django app to reduce development efforts. The objective is to streamline the license submission process, reduce manual effort, save time, and enhance productivity. The project proposes clear deliverables such as generating a .txt test file, differentiating exceptions from license submissions, adding or fixing unit tests, and improving error handling. The project will contribute to the open-source community and will provide a learning experience for the software engineering student working on the project. The choice of SPDX as the organization to work with is motivated by its mission to create a standard format for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights of software packages and its strong community of developers, contributors, and users committed to driving innovation in the field of software licensing.",

Problem\nstatement is that the license and copyright information (license, author, package version\netc.) of the project is stored in various different files and there is no single file\nrepresenting all this information. Therefore developing a tool which can give the\nSoftware bill of materials (SBOM) of any referenced file/directory in SPDX format is\nproposed. Approach is to develop a package to do this task by first parsing the metadata achieved from SWHIDs and forming an logic/algorithm for taking the necessary fields according to spdx format from retrieved data to generate valid spdx-document.",
