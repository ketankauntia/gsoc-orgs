Also, there are two major versions available currently: 12.10.5 - the stable release and 13.2 - the active latest release. Cloud computing has gained significant recognition in the past few years due to the availability of a virtually unlimited number of servers and unlimited power/memory availability within seconds while maintaining a pay-per-use model for billing. As companies and users move to Cloud-based solutions for their server needs, it makes sense that XWiki too should integrate seamlessly with major cloud provider solutions. Currently, Amazon’s AWS has the greatest market share in the Cloud Market, which is greater than the combined market share of Google (GCP) and Microsoft (Azure). Therefore we need to provide AMIs and Cloudformation Templates (in the context of AWS), which end users can consume directly to spin up XWiki within minutes and start testing/working.</p>\n",

          "description": "The project aims to develop an interactive link visualizer application for XWiki which shows the end-users a network-graph of pages present in a wiki in the form of nodes and edges. The application will consist of many feature like a separate customizable panel for a local graph (i.e., visualization around only the currently opened document), search feature, etc.\n\nThe nodes represents the various pages/documents and edges represents the links between them.\n\n\nFor complete documentation of the application, see:\nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/InteractiveLinkVisualizer\n\n\nEnd-users will get to visually interact, explore & analyze link relationships within XWiki pages & hence users will more easily:\n\n● Understand the structure of the documents and the relationships\nbetween them\n\n● Identify patterns and connections that may not be immediately\napparent when looking at the documents in text format.\n\n● Navigate through the platform and locate the information they need.\n\nThe final solution has been published in the form of an XWiki extension on the XWiki Extension Store where the users can install & use it on their XWiki instance.",
