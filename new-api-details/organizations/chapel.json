In this paper, The technique to calculate the \"pade estimate\" to categorize which \"pade value\" to be used for optimization has interested me to pursue this project. I also hope to understand and achieve the parallelization of the current task for efficient computation of matrix exponential and be challenged by the intricacies of Chapel.</p>\n",
