At present day CNN has been successfully applied in various fields of Computer Vision, for example: image classification [1, 2, 3], semantic segmentation [4], object detection [5], human pose estimation [6], etc. \nAlso some of the recent researches have tried to apply discriminating power of CNN for visual tracking purposes: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Almost all of them outperform state-of-art tracking algorithms (like TLD [12], KCF [13]) in terms of accuracy, but lose in terms of speed.\nOne of the most recent successful trackers based on CNN are MDNet and GOTURN. Though MDNet has been evaluated as a top – accuracy tracker (1-st place on VOT2015), it suffers from low performance (~1 FPS) due to CNN online learning. While GOTURN can run on around 100 FPS maintaining high accuracy and robustness (close to MDNet). Good speed/accuracy tradeoff makes GOTURN one of the most promising next-generation trackers.

Among all the available algorithms, phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) is one of the most popular and I believe OpenCV would benefit from its implementation. Unfortunately, PSP does not perform well on dynamic scenes since it belongs to time-multiplexing methods. Indeed, successive patterns are not deformed in the same way which leads to reconstruction errors. To reduce reconstruction errors due to motion, scientists had the idea to combine PSP with Fourier transform profilometry (FTP), a one-shot method that uses the same patterns. My goal for GSoC 2016 is to add PSP, FTP and Fourier assisted phase-shifting profilometry (FAPS) to OpenCV.  Spatial phase unwrapping, which is essential to PSP, FTP and FAPS, will be coded as an independent module due to its broad number of applications. Finally, as a proof of concept of scene understanding from structured light, an automatic piecewise-planar surfaces detection will be tested on the results provided by Fourier transform profilometry.</p>\n",

This algorithm was presented by   Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee.

By contrast, the bilateral solver is 10-1000× faster than existing  domain-specific approaches with comparable accuracy, and produces higher-quality output than lightweight filtering  techniques with comparable runtimes.</p>\n",

Using deep learning models for super resolution is a widely researched area, as they generally achieve better accuracy than classical computer vision based algorithms. There are many popular type of models used, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning methods. I propose to implement two deep learning based models to be a part of the OpenCV library. One is EDSR, which is a residual network based model, and is known for it’s high accuracy. The other one is LapSRN, which is a fast, but still accurate model, that can be deployed to real-time applications.

However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly.\nThe project has four objectives:\n1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model.\n2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end.\n3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model.\n4.

Optical flow is pivotal to many computer vision applications such as object tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis, providing essential information about the dynamics of a scene or an object. With the upsurge in the use of deep neural networks, DNN models were developed to solve the optical flow problem, achieving state-of-the-art results by learning to estimate motion from image data. However, DNNs can become computationally expensive making it infeasible to be deployed on embedded systems. This problem is tackled by the development of lightweight DNN models. However, OpenCV model zoo hasn't had any implementation of an optical flow lightweight model yet. Thus, this project aims to find the best lightweight optical flow model in terms of model size, speed, and accuracy to introduce to the OpenCV model zoo.",

          "description": "The current state-of-the-art tracking models are hampered by low speed, limiting their applicability on devices with limited computational power. Although Existing realtime object tracking models could reach high speeds on edge devices, their performance is poor. Consequently, the high-performance tracker with fast speed on edge devices is critical. I have two plans to solve this problem. The first Scheme is to use the pre-trained lightweight transformer as the tracking models' backbone and through the proper design, the tracking model not only has good performance because of the use of the pre-trained visual transformer but also because the visual transformer used is lightweight and does not slow down the model due to the huge amount of computation caused by the transformer. The second Scheme is to build a small tracking model and pre-train the small tracking model using the MAE pre-training method, and finally, choose the current best-performing transformer-based tracking model as the teacher model to train the student model. Eventually, two state-of-the-art real-time tracking models will be provided, along with their code, and they will be maintained over time.",

The end result will be a fully functioning data processing pipeline that is well integrated with the NeRF model training procedure, as well as online documentation that detail how to use the pipelines properly. There are 3 key deliverables for this project.\n\nFirst, implement data loaders that can process user-taken images of real-world scenes. This will involve using the COLMAP and OpenCV data processing pipelines in order to extract the camera poses and epipolar geometry of the scene; these are requirements for the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation of the given scene.\n\nSecond, build, train, and test the actual NeRF model. This will involve using PyTorch's built-in CUDA support and extensive usage of the PyTorch library as a whole in order to incorporate critical components of the NeRF architecture such as positional encoding, ray sampling, and regularization into our model design. This step will also include rendering procedures that will allow users to extract images/videos, depth maps, and other logging information such as the training loss curve from the fully trained model.\n\nThird, create simple and intuitive documentation on how to use both the data loaders and the NeRF code base. This will involve creating a page on OpenCV's documentation (via Doxygen) that will list out specific terminal commands that the user should use to train the model. It will also include a summary of required packages, recommended environment configurations, and links to other helpful resources such as YouTube video demonstrations, which will all be geared towards increasing the usability and accessibility of the pipeline.",

          "description": "I propose to integrate native text tokenization support into OpenCV’s DNN module so that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be run end-to-end directly in OpenCV. Currently, to feed text into models like GPT-2 or GPT-3, users must rely on external libraries (e.g. tiktoken) for tokenization. My project will create a built-in tokenizer utility—implemented in C++ with Python bindings—that can convert raw text into token IDs and decode model outputs back into text.  \n\nThe core deliverable is a new cv::dnn::Tokenizer class supporting Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), along with the ability to load typical vocabulary/merges files and handle special tokens. Once implemented, this will allow a seamless pipeline for text-based or multimodal models within OpenCV: raw text -> tokens -> DNN inference -> tokens -> decoded text. I will also write comprehensive documentation and test this functionality against known tokenizer outputs (e.g., Hugging Face), ensuring correctness and good performance.  \n\nBy adding native tokenization, OpenCV’s DNN module becomes more versatile for cutting-edge AI tasks involving both vision and language. This reduces external dependencies, makes it easier to deploy LLMs in pure C++ or Python environments, and helps unify image and text processing in a single library—further strengthening OpenCV as a comprehensive open-source toolkit.",

This will serve as both a practical tool for robotics applications and an educational resource for computer vision researchers. The project will culminate by integrating a fully functional SLAM framework in OpenCV with comprehensive documentation, enabling future extensions and adaptations by the broader computer vision community.\n\nTraditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) pipelines can fail in low-texture settings or with erratic motion, while naïve deep-learning usage often demands powerful GPUs. Our proposal addresses these shortcomings by integrating LightGlue (a neural network-based feature matching framework) and ALIKED (a learned keypoint extractor) into a streamlined SLAM system that retains real-time feasibility on modest hardware. This combination improves accuracy by reducing drift—a common issue in purely classical systems. \\\n\nThe project will unfold in two primary phases. Phase 1 focuses on building a Visual Odometry pipeline: feature extraction and matching, pose estimation, and basic mapping. Phase 2 expands this pipeline into a fully-fledged SLAM system by adding loop closure, global pose graph optimization, and map refinement. Together, these steps ensure global consistency and minimize drift over longer trajectories.",
