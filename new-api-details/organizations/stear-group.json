The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required.

We utilize a modern parallelization library, HPX, to develop the parallel solver. The goal of the proposed solution is to achieve full distribution of workload starting from mesh partition to computation of fields at mesh nodes. The following goal is achieved step by step, starting from a simple sequential implementation of 1D nonlocal diffusion. The 1D nonlocal diffusion equation is made multi-threaded to enable concurrent processing within a single node and then is extended to a 2D nonlocal diffusion equation. The 2D nonlocal diffusion equation is then made completely distributed to exploit data level parallelism.</p>\n",

A number of libraries implementing thread-safe (sometimes lock-free) containers already exist that can be used for ideas and where code uses a boost compatible license can be integrated into HPX.

A new chart containing a histogram of primitive duration has been created to filter out intervals of a specific duration. This supplements the user experience in discovery of intervals having too long or too short duration. Interpretability of the Gantt chart has been augmented by the addition of traceback lines (from a child interval to its parent) and color highlighting which eventually helps to track down dependent and relevant intervals. The hardware performance counter values have been made more explicit by representing aggregated (minimum, maximum, average) values. The Traveler interface is now equipped with more options for explorative performance analysis, better feature detection, easier artifact isolation, and faster debugging.</p>\n",

Essentially, std::relocate utilizes a single memcpy operation to move objects while avoiding unnecessary move-constructor and destructor calls. This improvement impacts key primitives like swap and vector.reserve, subsequently leading to speedup in higher-level algorithms such as rotate and sort.

The solution involves creating a specialized Thrust executor that extends HPX's CUDA executor capabilities, implementing automatic memory management for data transfers between host and device, and developing a dispatching mechanism that selects the appropriate backend (CPU or GPU) based on execution policies. Key technical components include a version-aware API layer to handle Thrust compatibility, exception handling that bridges Thrust/CUDA errors with HPX's error system, and template-based algorithm overloads that transparently route calls to Thrust implementations when GPU execution is requested. The implementation will proceed through four phases: establishing core infrastructure (executor, memory management), integrating fundamental algorithms (transform, reduce, sort), adding HPX execution policy support, and concluding with comprehensive testing and optimization. The resulting system will allow developers to write single code paths that automatically leverage GPU acceleration through Thrust when available, all while maintaining HPX's asynchronous execution model through future-based interfaces.",
