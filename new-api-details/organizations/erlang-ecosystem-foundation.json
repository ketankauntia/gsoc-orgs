The purpose of this project is to exercise APIs of riak-core-lite and have a reference implementation that is documented and maintained to test riak-core-lite changes. This implementation can also be used for detecting regressions and serve as a starting point to try new ideas and show how different parts of riak-core-lite are used in practice.</p>\n",
