          "description": "<p>MapAction’s mission is to provide people dealing with humanitarian emergencies with supportive maps as quickly as possible. Currently most of such maps are produced manually by experts. The problem is this process might take hours while each spent minute costs people’s lives. Thus, automatization of map producing is mandatory. That’s why MapChef was created. MapChef works with recipes to create maps. In the wild, however, data is not represented in MapChef’s desired format. It must be prepared. And since manual data acquisition and preprocessing is time-consuming, creating a pipeline for automatization of this work is highly desired. Recently, a series of data pipelines has been implemented.</p>\n<p>At the moment MapAction’s data pipeline framework can deal with two types of data: country boundaries from HDX and roads from OSM. This project aims to extend this pipeline to other types of data. Achieving this will increase the quality of the automatically generated maps. As a result, MapAction will be able to provide people responding to crisis with significantly more vital information immediately after an emergency.</p>\n",
