Beyond introduction of JIT to SQL subsystem there are multiple smaller improvements which might be developed for SQL virtual machine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>merge CHECKs bytecode into a monolithic program;</li>\n<li>add VDBE assembler;</li>\n<li>use threaded interpretation.\nThe easiest approach in its implementation is 'threaded-code'. Threaded code is a programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines. It is often used in compilers, which may generate code in that form or be implemented in that form themselves. The code may be processed by an interpreter or it may simply be a sequence of machine code call instructions.\nAnother optimization is instruction merging: a sequence of opcodes is replaced by a single mega opcode. There is a proposal to create a single VDBE running all the CHECK constraints.</li>\n</ul>\n",
