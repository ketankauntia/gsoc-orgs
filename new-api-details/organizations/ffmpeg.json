It can be used for image and video processing to make them clearer and it can be a preprocessing method for many computer vision systems. We propose to implement this technology in FFmpeg.

It can be readily implemented in hardware or software at very high bit rates. It can also be efficiently implmented on GPU hardware.\n\n\nTo this, end, an encoder and a decoder must be implemented and tested with\nthe VC-2 conformance software.\nThe encoder requires a wavelet transform, quantization, etropy coding and writing back the result in a proper format and bitstream coding.\nThe decoder, in turn, reuires: bitstream parsing, entropy decoding, dequantization and another wavelet transform.",
