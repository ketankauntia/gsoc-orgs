Main focus of this project is to add various profile tags such as location data, role, tools, skills to user profiles which improves user base community side interaction. Improving the current Barnstar implementation by providing a new layout in profile page. In the current system, comments are displayed with image icon and description which will be refactored based on the role user possess such as admin, moderator, organizer. On the other hand as huge amount of data is rendered in the front end of the application, response time is another important factor project will focus on. I will be using agile software development method which includes iterative and incremental approach</p>\n<p>My work can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/commits/master?author=lalithr95\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/commits/master?author=lalithr95</a></p>\n",

The core functionality is being implemented. There are a few modules present. Calculations aren’t GPU accelerated. As a result, there is a lag when images larger than 700KB are handled. Also, Image Sequencer works only for browsers currently as it uses a browser dependency (the JavaScript Image Class). Image Sequencer currently supports only one image at a time.</p>\n<h5>Aim of my project</h5>\n<p>The aim of my Project is to expand the module library by implementing powerful processing modules (As listed at the end of this proposal) followed by enabling GPU-backed calculations for browser based clients and hence enhance performance, reliability and speed. And, ultimately, to develop Image Sequencer as an importable library for image manipulation and publish it on NPM. Also, support for Node.js based clients and JSON input/output will be generated.</p>\n",

So currently, mails are sended synchronously. And if the sending of mail is failed due to some reason or we don't want to send the mail at the time of request/response or if we want that a mail should be sent after (1 day or any specific period of time) we can't implement it now.\nSometimes, we have to run jobs at particular intervals to, say, backup logs, send emails, etc. In rails application we can schedule such tasks using the whenever gem.\nFor integrating cron jobs with the plots2 we can implement whenever gem which will be very useful in sending daily \"batch digest\" email to the subscribers. We can specify the time when the email should be sent. More details on implementation is in Implementation part.\nAnother feature is the reply-by-email feature using mailman gem.\nFeature that we can implement is of reply by tweet which is very convenient and easy for the user to do.</p>\n",
