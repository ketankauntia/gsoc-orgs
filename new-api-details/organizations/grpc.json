The\nRPC handlers are inherently ephemeral; these services do not guarantee\nthe persistence of state between invocations, so serverless-computing\nmust be used in conjunction with a cloud database.  We propose\nbuilding an RPC-aware storage engine that runs alongside these\nserverless-computing platforms.  There are several opportunities for\ntight integration: (1) client RPC calls introduce new, meaningful\nconsistency boundaries; (2) RPC schedulers aware of database replicas\ncan make better locality decisions; and (3) coordinating handler\npausing with database change batches would improve performance.\nOur database will coordinate with handler workers via gRPC calls.</p>\n",
