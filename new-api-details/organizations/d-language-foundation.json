One way of solving both of these problems is by moving runtime hooks to use templates instead.

These hooks currently rely on dynamic type resolution via TypeInfo, introducing overhead that limits optimization opportunities. By leveraging D’s template metaprogramming, this work will enable compile-time specialization of these operations, improving runtime performance, potentially reducing binary sizes, and simplifying DRuntime maintenance. To achieve all this, my proposed solution comprises of three systematic steps for each hook: \n1. Template implementation: Rewriting the hook as a template function in DRuntime, replacing the runtime TypeInfo queries with compile-time type parameters.\n2. Compiler Integration: Modifying the DMD frontend to generate calls to the new templated hooks during the lowering phase.\n3. Validation and Benchmarking: Verifying correctness through unit tests and quantifying performance improvements using benchmarks.",
