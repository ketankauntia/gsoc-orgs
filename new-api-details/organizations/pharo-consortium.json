By applying inlining, which involves replacing method calls with the actual code of the methods, the number of method calls in the virtual machine will be reduced, thus enhancing execution speed. The project will extend DRUID by supporting complex cases like block closures, improving the type system, and conducting thorough performance benchmarking.\nDeliverables will include the implementation of bytecode-level inlining, the enhancement of the type inference system, testing and validating the new compiler, and performance analysis.",

This approach introduces two key issues:\n1. garbage collection overhead: the GC must scan and track pointers within machine code, increasing complexity and runtime costs.\n2. security risks: direct pointer exposure in executable code creates opportunities for attackers to alter program behavior.\n\nThis project aims to refactor the VM to store object pointers in a separate structure so that the GC can use this structure during memory management. The development plan can be decomposed into three stages:\n1. Analyze the JIT compiler to identify where object pointers are embedded in machine code. A documentation or a technical blog should follow after this step.\n2. Modify the JIT compiler to use a dedicated structure to store object pointers.\n3. Refactor the GC to use the new object-pointer structure instead of scanning machine code during memory management.",

          "description": "This project aims to build ChatPharo, an intelligent, AI-powered assistant that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the Pharo development environment. Despite Pharo’s strengths as a live programming platform, it currently lacks a native and user-friendly interface for interacting with LLMs to assist with code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging.\n\nTo address this, the project proposes a seamless, modular, and extensible system that connects Pharo with both online (OpenAI, DeepSeek) and offline (TinyLLaMA, Mistral-7B via Ollama) models. A multi-tab chat interface will allow users to manage multiple contextual conversations, while intelligent AI commands (e.g., /explain, /generate tests, /refactor) will directly support day-to-day coding workflows. Memory optimization techniques—including smart caching, chat pruning, and lazy model loading—will ensure smooth performance even in long sessions.\n\nA key innovation includes experimenting with pseudo-parallelism in Pharo’s single-threaded architecture by spawning secondary images to offload heavy LLM processing. This enables parallel task handling without compromising the responsiveness of the main Pharo image.\n\nBy midterm, users will have access to a working chat UI, multi-LLM switching, and foundational coding actions. By the final evaluation, ChatPharo will evolve into a context-aware assistant capable of inline suggestions, AI-driven debugging, and scalable architecture for future extensions.\n\nThrough full documentation, tutorials, and community engagement, this project will not only enhance developer productivity but also showcase Pharo as a capable, modern AI-enhanced development platform.",
