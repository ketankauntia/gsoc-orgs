However, those features are biased. Indeed, during the loading of the new binary, Rizin uses various information that aren't relevant as default loading data. For example, Rizin loads sections information at the start. But it is common knowledge that section information can be manipulated without modifying the program execution. With this issue comes the fact that Rizin uses section information to deduct imported functions, strings and for other various analyses. Therefore, we need to make the section loading optional. The second problem is how Rizin loads PLT data. Currently, the PLT is linked to the GOT using hard coded values, which should be replaced by a dynamic analysis like in Ghidra.</p>\n",

The project will also try to expand the number of heap allocators that Rizin supports. After completing this project, users would be able to get information about the state of the heap in Cutter and do this for cases of remote debugging and a variety of allocators. \nAs part of the project, the following are the key features that will be added and changed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widgets in Cutter for the following:</li>\n<li>Bins Info (Fastbins, Unsorted, Small, Large)</li>\n<li>T-cache Info for each thread</li>\n<li>Arenas Info (chunks, top, last remainder)</li>\n<li>Graph visualization for bins and tcache</li>\n<li>Improve the implementation of heap related commands like <code>dmh</code> in Rizin</li>\n<li>Refactor the Rizin code to make heap parsing work for non-native code</li>\n<li>Add heap parsing for other allocators like MacHeap.</li>\n</ul>\n",
