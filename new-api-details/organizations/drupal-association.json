But there is not yet a way to SOLVE revision conflicts. \nThe proposed solution is to create PHP library which would find lowest common ancestor(LCA) from DAG and perform a recursive 3 way merge with LCA as base file. The libraries would merge the updates in base file if no conflict arises.  However, for the case when a merge conflict occurs and has to be solved manually, a JS code editor library(CodeMirror) would be integrated with Plugin UI which would allow users to solve a merge conflict by displaying all the 3 files(Base, Theirs and Mine) in a 3 pane view.\nMore details: <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/508466#project35\" target=\"_blank\">https://groups.drupal.org/node/508466#project35</a></p>\n",

The two use cases which were used in the description were much interested. I was learning with the react over the past 10 months. So I would like to solve the problem in a good manner like combining the react with PHP or Python.  So, First of all, they asked us to build a menu section that should be globally active around the other pages. This can be done by the react components. Which I had the idea of doing it. In the second use case, they asked to create a menu(s) that changes from page to page like the \"Content Moderator Shortcuts\" menu to the \"moderator\" role. Which we can implement with React router dom. But the main task of this objective is to combine the react with drupal. While we know Drupal still serves as a backend repository, front-end frameworks can talk to the database via API calls. By making the  Make a stand-alone front-end and using drupal to create APIs which interact with the database. Then consume the API through HTTP AJAX or whatever mechanism React Js contains. Yeah, while coming to symphony it's been a task for me to learn it for using it as a framework. I have already had a little experience with the laravel framework.
