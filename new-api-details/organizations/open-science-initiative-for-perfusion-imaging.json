These parameters cannot be measured directly and must be inferred from signal progression over time in techniques such as Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The estimation is complicated by measurement noise, model ambiguity, and the sensitivity of parameter estimates to small variations in the data.\nTo improve robustness and accuracy, this project will implement a Bayesian framework that incorporates prior physiological knowledge and observed MRI signals to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters. For the pharmacokinetic modeling the Tofts model for DCE-MRI and perfusion modeling for ASL will be used. Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling and gradient-based optimization methods may improve the robustness of the reconstruction.\n\n\nDeliverables include:\n    – An extensible implementation of the BBB modeling pipeline using OSIPI tools\n    – Support for both DCE-MRI and ASL data,\n    – Parameter estimation via Bayesian inference and optimization,\n    – Comprehensive documentation and integration into the OSIPI project.",
