So, it will give more power to users to control their devices. \nI will also implement amahi 12 in Fedora 30 using anaconda addon, which is in PYTHON.</p>\n<p>If time left then I propose to improve the installation experience of Amahi by completely removing the method of INSTALL CODE and setting up basic Amahi HDA without an API key.\nThis will remove the hassle of registration before using Amahi.</p>\n<p>Since, I have worked with Amahi before, especially with installing and setting up Amahi division.
