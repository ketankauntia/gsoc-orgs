After working on Alpha One Labs for long, I’ve realised that with all the current components like courses, videos, blogs, quizzes…. The one component that is missing is indeed the most important one - A Virtual Classroom.  (and what if this virtual classroom becomes a 2D user controlled experience?)\n\nI am going to implement a 2D user controlled classroom experience. A game like interface where the user can go around the classroom, take seats with their friends, interact with multiple areas of the class, like the whiteboard, assignments table, breakout rooms, working on assignments alone or as teams, and a lot more.\n\nAlong with this im building an AI assistant available throughout the website.\nThis AI assistant will be your guide for any feature at Alpha One. The need of this has increased with the number of features at Alpha One.\nAny query regarding the working of the website will be resolved instantly.\n\nat the end of the project we will have:\nA 2D user-controlled classroom experience with integration of multiple existing features at Alpha One and new features, which will also act as independent features for the platform.\nAn AI assistant available on all pages of Alpha One, resolving any query regarding the website instantly.",

By combining PyMuPDF, specialized table detection models, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the system will significantly improve accuracy over traditional OCR methods while maintaining cost efficiency. The pipeline allows users to upload multiple research papers, select their preferred extraction method, and receive structured markdown outputs with preserved document hierarchy. A side-by-side interface will enable human verification and correction of extraction results. The solution will be optimized for lightweight deployment on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible to researchers worldwide while focusing primarily on complex table formats common in life science research.",
