The proposed design can be briefly divided as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Central Server</strong> based on <a href=\"https://github.com/mementoweb/timegate\" target=\"_blank\">memento timegate</a>, which will allow users to query peers and facilitate P2P cache sharing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Amber nodes</strong> with added APIs for cache sharing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Security Measurements</strong> to prevent misuse of the system by using <strong>Public-key cryptography</strong> and <strong>Reputation based cache resolving</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Technologies:\nPython, PHP, Networking concepts, Basic cryptography</p>\n",

In particular, instead of naively focusing on the existence of the topic in the article, techniques with machine learning can broaden the search range by including more relevant secondary keywords in addition to the various variation of the given topic. Meanwhile, methods (such as SVM, nearest neighbor) can also be employed to prune the fetched articles to filter out those are irrelevant to our topic despite containing the exact words on the topic. Furthermore, due to the fact that articles may use different choices of words over time, time series analysis needs to be applied to keep track of the evolution of one topic during a certain period of time. In this project, I plan to design and implement a proof of concept unsupervised machine learning approach to retrieve articles and prune the results, with the assistance of mathematical models.</p>\n",

SwellRT use operational transformations (OTs) to coordinate the insertion and deletion of characters in its documents, so instead of encrypting the entire document, we need to encrypt each operation and still guarantee that the server has enough information to coordinate the document editioning. Fortunately, it is a field that has been researched for many years and we have some studies that have successfully implemented E2EE in Google Docs. We can take their insights to encrypt SwellRT OTs.</p>\n<p>The project has two parts. First, we need to encrypt and decrypt successfully SwellRT OTs, using a symmetric key.

For example Trello, Twitter, Facebook and many others.

This will help in future-proofing the code against the ageing Rails asset management pipeline as well give access to the testing modules and other plugins from NodeJS ecosystem for building a state-of-the-art front-end.

Mediaviz uses force atlas 2 layout as default and scales the layout automatically for graphs with 100-1000 nodes that has a power law linking structure, but it can also be used with other layout algorithms.</p>\n",
