          "description": "<p>Lemmatization is a core preprocessing task for NLP which allows for meaningful comparisons of different forms of a given word in a corpus. For highly inflected languages like Latin and Greek, the task is particularly important for two reasons: 1. words often have a dozen or more possible forms (and, as opposed to go in English, this is the norm and not only a characteristic of irregularly formed words), and 2. small corpus size in general often demands that counts for a given feature like words be based on the broadest measure possible. Currently available Latin lemmatizers rely largely on dictionary-based look up methods, which is a good solution for frequently occurring and unambiguous forms. For my Google Summer of Code project, I propose to rewrite the CLTK Latin and Greek lemmatizers to handle a higher percentage of forms by applying a backoff tagging approach.</p>\n",

For example, a number of Old French texts from the BNF's 19th century editions have been digitized and made available at gallica.fr. \nLemmas will be sourced from Godefroy's 1901 \"Lexique de l'Ancien Français\" and the \"Dictionnaire Electronique de Chrétien de Troyes\", which has the advantage of English-language definitions.</p>\n",

The goal of this project is to enable CLTK to reconstruct a  normalized spelling out of CDLI’s ATF text and thus create data available for two fundamental uses: 1) allowance of individuals to learn and practice Akkadian with real and novel reading exercises; and 2) with further class development, be analyzed on a mass scale.</p>\n",

Lemmatization is the process by which inflected word-forms are grouped together under their dictionary headings. This allows us to gather accurate word-usage statistics, analyze authorship, and model subject matter in classical corpora. However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.</p>\n<p>I propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship.</p>\n",
