Currently, the data types that Mathesar can support are limited and do not include JSON. Allowing users to read and manipulate data in JSON format can signiﬁcantly improve the practical value of Mathesar and meet various application scenarios. In this project, we will suport importing, adding, change a database ﬁeld to a JSON object and enable data validation, modiﬁcation, and browsing. Also, it will allow the grouping, ﬁltering, and sorting operations based on JSON keys.",

We aim to expand this functionality into importing JSON and Excel files too. The project will allow users to import JSON and Excel files and create a table from the imported data. The user can preview the table, remove/rename columns, change data types, and more. If the imported file is not in a suitable format for creating a table, we will develop algorithms to convert the file into a suitable format. If the algorithm doesn’t work, the system will refuse to import the file and give the user a readable error.",
