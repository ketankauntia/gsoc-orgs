Besides that, hydrus supports a basic two-factor authentication using user-nonce and user credentials. The security feature could be greatly improved if we could have a straight-forward way to create an API gateway to the hydrus instances. Also, the hydrus codebase has to be refactored for better readability / maintainability of the code. The current database schema can also be improved which would make hydrus more efficient.
