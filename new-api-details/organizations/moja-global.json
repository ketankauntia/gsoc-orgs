Moja global User-interface (UI) library project aims to bring forward an intuitive, consistent, and easy-to-use interface that can help the developers within the User-Interface working group and users to quickly accomplish their tasks. The UI library aims to considerably improve the design & development workflow and meet the acceptable web accessibility requirements for potential users. A UI library helps to mitigate popular UI-development issues like inconsistent user experience, performance issues, accessibility requirements, and more. To achieve this, a centralized collection of components would be developed which will encompass the color branding of moja global, typography, spacing, buttons, modals, and forms. The big picture is that the UI library will allow all the upcoming moja global projects, with a client-facing focus, to have a consistent design language that will help us to quickly and easily build their user interface.",
