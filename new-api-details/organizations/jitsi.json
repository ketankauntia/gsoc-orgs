Currently, developers have embedded many useful functionalities into Jitsi Meet, such as shared document editing, remote presentation, etc. Here, I propose to bring face and speech recognition into Jitsi Meet. First of all, I plan to add \"Show your face\" prompts for Jitsi Meet. In this case, if a user's face is not well positioned, it will prompt the user to move to the center. Additionally, if time is enough during the summer, I will also add speech-to-text functionality in Jitsi Meet. With the help of speech recognition, there could be a transcript generated automatically for a conference.</p>\n",

The Prometheus Scraping & Grafana Dashboard project for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) aims to integrate Prometheus to collect metrics from each container seamlessly. By leveraging Prometheus exporters within Jitsi's infrastructure, essential metrics such as resource utilization, network traffic, and service availability will be gathered. These metrics will then be visually represented through Grafana dashboards, providing administrators with actionable insights to enhance system performance and facilitate proactive troubleshooting.\n\nThis integration promises to make stronger operational efficiency and reliability within Jitsi's infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted video conferencing experiences for users. To further enhance monitoring capabilities, triggers will be set up to notify administrators through communication channels in the event of any issues. By empowering administrators with comprehensive monitoring capabilities, the project underscores Jitsi's dedication to delivering high-quality communication solutions. With Prometheus and Grafana at its core, this initiative not only enhances observability but also strengthens Jitsi's ability to maintain and optimize its complex environment, furthering its commitment to providing a seamless communication experience.",
