A Capture Engine buffers trace data in SMP-safe manner and records it on the target. RTEMS uses its own format for the traces. In this project we propose to modify the tracing framework to generate traces in the standardized Common Trace Format (CTF). CTF is a bit-packed trace-format used by a range of monitoring and visualisation tools (eg. Babeltrace). In the next phase, I will implement live-tracing functionality over a set of popular transport mechanisms(eg. USB, JTAG). Using LTTng tools we can visualise and analyse these live-traces on the host. I will focus on measuring and minimizing the overhead added due to tracing.</p>\n",

Currently, the users who use RTEMS on their BBB project, can’t use an HDMI display to their project due to the lack of a framebuffer driver in the BBB Board Support Package. The project is mainly focused on adding the Framebuffer driver, this will enable the users to attach a display with their BBB project that uses RTEMS. The end product of the project will be a graphic console. Once the framebuffer driver is working and a console can be accessed through the HDMI display, it will open the way for further addition of graphics libraries, like the mouse support.</p>\n",

CAN protocol is a robust, reliable and multi-master serial communication protocol used to achieve real-time message transfer between devices within the CAN network. RTEMS being a real-time operating system, CAN peripheral support would increase the potential to meet real-time demands.\n\nBBB has two CAN 2.0 A, B (ISO 11898-1) controllers with 1 Mbps data transfer rate and DMA support. It also has inbuilt RAM which can hold 64 CAN messages. There is a loopback support also, which can be used for debugging purposes. By adding driver support for CAN modules, will enable the use of this potential hardware. With the help of the Am335x reference manual, TI’s starterware firmware and CAN specification I could understand the initialization and working of the CAN module. With the help of existing RTEMS supported CAN drivers I could understand the CAN framework and develop the support for CAN modules for BBB in RTEMS.\n\nI chose this project because I started learning embedded systems from BeagleBone Black and developed firmware from scratch with few peripherals and shell support https://github.com/slpp95prashanth/Beaglebone-mBootloader/tree/cpsw. As SoC and RTEMS are open source computing platforms, I would like to contribute to this project and learn more about RTEMS operating systems.",

In RTEMS, the interrupt handler takes care of this job. It is important to note here that different architectures or BSPs use different methods to handle these interrupts and historically, In RTEMS, set_vector() with different implementations is used for this purpose. \n\nHowever, the set_vector() function has been deprecated due to improper pointer usage. This project aims to remove its implementations, prototypes, and usages across all architectures and BSPs. It will be replaced with rtems_interrupt_entry_install(), rtems_interrupt_catch(), _CPU_ISR_install_raw_handler(), or alternative methods, depending on whether the interrupt should be unmasked or handled using non-RTEMS ISRs.",
