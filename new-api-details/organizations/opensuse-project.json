This project aims to give an option to companies and individuals deploying Jangouts to use this service in a user-friendly way. This task can be completed by sending WebRTC events and measurement data from the Jangouts application and the Janus media server in real-time to callstats.io. The idea is to integrate the callstats.io REST API with the WebRTC components in Jangouts and Janus. The Jangouts app will send endpoint stats and Janus will send the stats related to the WebRTC gateway.</p>\n",

That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list order,  ASCII mode auto-switch, reposition, show or hide candidate box page buttons, set system tray settings, input source indicator with settings. Theme and background picture follow GNOME Night Light Mode, and so on. These customizations will make users find IBus in GNOME familiar if they have just switched from another platform. Eventually, an extension providing full customization of appearance, behavior, system tray, input source indicator for IBus will be available.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/IBus-Customize\" target=\"_blank\">Archived Codebase</a></h4>\n",

The intention is to get rid of the existing binary rpm packages . This project aims to mock all the 132 binary rpm packages used exclusively for testing purposes in the rpmlint repository, which will significantly improve testing speed and facilitate easy testing development.\n\nTo achieve the project's goals, I will collaborate with my mentor and devise a strategy for mocking the binary packages using the pytest framework. The deliverables for this project include a redesigned testing framework that is more efficient and reliable than the existing one. Additionally, the project aims to mock all the existing binary packages, which will help streamline testing processes and accelerate software development.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Coming up with redesigned testing framework using mocking strategy.\n2. Mocking all the existing binary packages",

          "description": "Uyuni is the open-source upstream of SUSE Manager, a configuration and infrastructure management solution for administering multiple Linux systems. To ensure code quality, Uyuni employs two types of tests:\n\n1. Continuous Integration Tests: These tests are run periodically on the master branch to catch breakages that have slipped through earlier testing. When these tests fail, developers must revisit older tasks, leading to frequent context switching and reduced productivity.\n\n2. Pull Request Acceptance Tests: These tests are run on new pull requests to prevent breakages from reaching the master branch. They provide fast feedback to developers, helping them fix issues while they are still focused on their tasks.\n\nCurrently, Pull Request Acceptance Tests execute most of the test suite, with an average runtime of one hour. This delays feedback for developers and increases infrastructure costs.\n\nThis project aims to develop a machine learning model that, using past pull requests, test results, code coverage data, and other relevant information, predicts which small subset of tests is most likely to fail for a new pull request. Running only this smaller subset of tests will speed up developer feedback, reduce infrastructure costs, and maintain high test coverage.\n\nInspired by Facebook's Predictive Test Selection paper, this project applies and extends its techniques to optimize Uyuni’s testing strategy and increase developer productivity.",

          "description": "Today, with Ubuntu increasingly adopting Snap packages, Uyuni currently lacks support for managing these applications. This project proposes adding native Snap support to Uyuni, including install, update, remove, and channel management. By extending Uyuni’s capabilities to cover Snap, this work fills a key gap and ensures continued relevance for Ubuntu system management.\n\nI explored how Uyuni manages CVE audits and package upgrades for Ubuntu systems. Initially, Uyuni connects to client machines via SSH to install and register the Salt Minion. Once set up, all communication occurs through Salt’s remote execution system, eliminating the need for SSH. Salt gathers package data using grains, pillars, and custom modules, which Uyuni then compares to its centralized SUSE Manager database.\n\nFor CVE auditing, Uyuni fetches security metadata (e.g., CVEs, OVAL data) from upstream sources like Ubuntu Security Notices and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. When Salt reports installed packages, Uyuni analyzes the data and generates patch or upgrade recommendations. APT repositories are mirrored into structured software channels, allowing clients to receive updates without direct internet access.\n\nBuilding on this workflow, I propose extending Uyuni to support Snap packages. While Snap lacks structured CVE metadata, we can implement a version-based upgrade system: Uyuni retrieves the latest Snap versions from the Snap Store and compares them to client versions reported via Salt, suggesting upgrades when newer versions exist.\n\nTo support airgapped environments, we can pre-download .snap and .assert files on a connected system and distribute them through Uyuni’s software channels. Additionally, to manage storage and stability, Uyuni admins can choose which Snap channels (stable, beta, etc.) to mirror—defaulting to stable.\n\nDeliverables: Support Snap auditing, lifecycle management, airgapped environments, testing/validation, and user documentation in Uyuni.",

The problem is that processing Salt events can be resource-intensive, potentially affecting the performance of the web application also running in Tomcat. By decoupling these components, I'll create a containerized service that processes Salt events independently, improving overall system performance and reliability.\n\nThe implementation will involve extracting the existing Salt event processing logic, packaging it as a standalone service, containerizing it, and extending Uyuni-tools to deploy and manage this new component with scalable considerations. The current event processing logic will be preserved while adding proper scaling, monitoring, and configuration capabilities.\n\nDeliverables include a fully functional Salt event processor containerized service, integration with Uyuni-tools for deployment management, documentation, and performance benchmarks showing improvements.
