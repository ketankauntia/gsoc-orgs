The proposed GSoC project will provide the functionality for a more convenient editing of public transport routes either by creating new ways between stops with a routing algorithm or by replicating them from existing public transport routes. Furthermore, it will elaborate criteria of route correctness and validate the existing routes against those criteria. There are Python scripts written by Polyglot to find ways that belong to a route described by its stops and to compare a given route to an already existing route. However, their installation requires additional steps, so for a better usability an extended version of this functionality needs to be implemented as part of the JOSM public transport plugin.</p>\n",

To implement this repository by the proposed deadline, I have decided to use the Django/Python framework, with PostgreSQL as the database backend, and for the front end Bootstrap was chosen. The OpenLayers library will also be used to render slippy maps to the user. The repository includes an user interface allowing uploading models from an authenticated OSM account through the OAuth mechanism, and an API for 3D visualizers to use, so that they can query the repository for models. Finally, while there were a plethora of interesting features that could be included in the deadline checklists, I have opted for only having the essential features required for a 3D repository as deliverables, with the rest as extra features, to be added if time allows it.</p>\n",

To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to create a script that can process a Wikidata dump and extract the information that would be useful to Nominatim, then import the data it into the Nominatim database. Nominatim already uses Wikipedia links to improve search results, and where Wikidata is available it can help determine the correct Wikipedia link that should be used whenever a Wikipedia link does not exist for an OSM object. This can be done both by directly matching objects to their Wikipedia links via Wikidata, and also by ensuring that links are made to the correct type of object and that links are not made to vague pages such as those that describe brands or other information that is not relevant to search result ranking.</p>\n",

          "description": "Valhalla is a routing engine built on OpenStreetMap data, that allows for high flexibility by providing diverse routing modes and routing filters. \n\nInitially, Valhalla received transit data from Transitland API, which converts GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data into a database. However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. \n\nThere are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code.  Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",

When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are:\n\n1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files \n2) Developing the import functionality\n3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers\n4) Writing unit tests\n5) Documenting the new changes",

          "description": "The iD Editor is a powerful tool used by thousands to contribute to OpenStreetMap, but its current session management system relies on localStorage, which poses several usability and technical challenges. With a small 5MB storage limit and synchronous behavior that blocks the main thread, users often face sluggish performance and occasional data loss. These issues become even more pronounced when users work across multiple browser tabs, where localStorage provides no real synchronization, leading to conflicts and inconsistent states between sessions.\n\nThis project proposes to modernize session management in iD by adopting IndexedDB for efficient, large-scale, and non-blocking data storage. A key focus will be enabling real-time multi-tab editing support using the BroadcastChannel API to keep changes synchronized across tabs without clobbering data. The project will also improve crash resilience, ensure safe cleanup of resources using modern browser lifecycle events like pagehide, and introduce a graceful fallback for older browsers. Together, these improvements aim to make iD more robust, responsive, and aligned with modern web standards while keeping the editing experience reliable and smooth for all contributors.",

The system will maintain a rolling in-memory buffer that continuously records session data, allowing developers to capture interactions leading up to an error or manually enable recording for testing.

Additionally, targeted UI/UX improvements in the Every Door app will create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
