The naive perception is often that speech is built with words, and each word consists of phones. The reality is unfortunately very different. Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished parts. It's always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of the speech and listen to it.\nAll modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are never 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who usually work with deterministic systems. And it creates a lot of issues specific only to speech technology.\nThe system is intended to develop Language model and Acoustic model to be used for speech recognition of Malayalam Language.</p>\n",

The statistical approaches have hardly been tried with a few exceptions. Apart from few statistical approaches, which use phrase based SMT and generative joint source-channel model for transliteration, most of the works on transliteration use rules defined over character mappings. In this proposal, I propose statistical learning for transliteration. The model parameters are learned from transliteration pairs which are automatically mined from parallel corpora.</p>\n",
