This task is performed asynchronously in background via celery without blocking main thread. Fuzzy locations are identified through `fuzzy` field. Using custom filters will enable filtering instances having `fuzzy` locations on admin level. At API level, `django-filters` will be used to provide the similar filtering functionalities as admin to maintain consistency.  Using a BriefSerializer for summary details and a DetailedSerializer for complete details fetch of WHOIS record on API level for device details and list APIs will provide flexibility. The fuzzy locations will be managed at global and organizational level using `FallbackBooleanChoiceField`, maintaining consistency with existing configuration practices.\n\nAs per above implementation, this feature will allow users to get WHOIS details of their devices if its 'last_ip' changes and is public ip allowing to manage it better and get its estimate location—unless manually refined. Updated locations will trigger notifications, improving device visibility and management. Users will be able to enable/disable fuzzy locations via configuration at global/organization level. The WHOIS record will be fetched at summary level (on device details and list APIs) and an option to view detailed view on device details API. The Device admin UI will display the newly fetched WHOIS details alongside last_ip with filters for devices having fuzzy locations. The Location admin interface will include clear indicators for fuzzy locations, along with filters to help users identify and manage such locations. The APIs will provide similar filtering functionality as admin also involving the fetched details in required APIs.",
