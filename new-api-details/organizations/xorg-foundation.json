The GPU scheduler is now used by amdgpu and etnaviv (graphics driver for Vivante GPUs). It provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs into queues which are then executed by a hardware run queue. Now amdgpu has multiple identical hardware queues and we currently map round robin to the software queues provided by the GPU scheduler when those are created.

The AMDGPU driver is the largest one in the kernel, with the DML component being particularly nasty as it doesn't adhere to many of the codebase's standards.\n\nKUnit is a framework for performing unit tests in a manageable way, without requiring basically any setup at all, and that would be used for testing the files under the DML component.\n\nThus, my project encompasses (1) making patches for testing those files, as well as refactoring and documenting them. (2) Producing blog posts about my experiences with the community and the project, tutorials on what I learned, and explanations that are less technical than the proper documentation, so as to reach more people. (3) Generating proper coverage reports and documenting the process for doing so. (4) I also plan on contributing to KWorkflow and IGT GPU tools to some extent, so as to make the project, all around, more useful for the kernel's engineers and also integrable in their CI tools.\n\nPlease check out the X.Org official project page: https://www.x.org/wiki/AMDGPU2022/",

This eases the development of a working PipeWire client, making it possible to implement support for a wider range of formats and more advanced features later.",
