To achieve that, multiple Doxia macros are implemented - for the examples, properties, parent module, and violation messages. These macros are then used in XDoc templates that generate the final website. Moreover, the class Javadoc of every module is to be removed in order to avoid having to keep the same documentation in sync in two places.\n\nAll this achieves more accurate examples in the documentation website and less workload for developers who have to maintain the documentation.",
