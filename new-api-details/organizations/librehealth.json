          "description": "Premature birth is highly prevalent with every one in ten births being premature. A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",

The project aims to improve the user experience, accuracy, and reliability of the app by revamping its user interface, improving the rule-based classification algorithm, resolving syncing issues on local storage and the DHIS2 rule engine, enhancing the app's functionality, and developing user manuals and training materials. The project will be implemented in four phases using Agile Development Methodology. \nThe first phase will revamp the application based on UX changes, the second phase will improve the rule-based classification algorithm, the third phase will address DHIS2 rule engine and syncing issues, and the fourth phase will focus on documentation. The enhancements proposed in the design include making the application more accessible and user-friendly with more visual cues, legible fonts, and features that increase functionality. The goal is to ensure that healthcare workers in low and middle-income regions have essential knowledge, skills, and competencies to deliver life-saving care to newborns.",

With my extensive experience in UI/UX design, I will work closely with the LibreHealth EHR team to gather feedback on the current UI and design an updated version that aligns with their needs. I believe that this will enhance the overall user experience and make the application more user-friendly.\n\nFinally, I understand the importance of documentation in ensuring that developers can easily understand and work with the codebase. As such, I will update and improve the project's documentation to ensure that other developers can easily understand the codebase and contribute to the project. I will document the migration process, including any adjustments made to the current codebase, to ensure that it is clear and understandable to other developers.\n\nIn summary, I am excited to contribute to the LibreHealth EHR project by migrating the User's Module to the new Laravel codebase, revamping the User Interface, and updating the documentation. I believe that my skills and expertise make me a strong candidate for this project, and I am committed to ensuring its success and helping it achieve its mission of providing high-quality medical software to medical practices and clinics globally.",

One common complication of prematurity is neonatal hypothermia, which can be effectively treated with Kangaroo Mother Care/Skin-to-Skin care (KMC/STS). However, the implementation of KMC/STS is limited by various barriers such as inadequate healthcare workforce and the labor-intensive nature of neonatal care, leading to inconsistent scale-up of KMC/STS.\n\nThe goal of this project is to developed to automate vital sign monitoring, facilitate multi-patient tracking, and enable shared goal setting for education, KMC, and discharge. The primary aim of this application is to provide timely alerts to parents and caregivers upon detecting any abnormality in vital signs, thus preventing adverse outcomes. The feasibility and acceptability of this device in US health facilities are being evaluated.",

          "description": "The LibreHealth Radiology AI Model service aids radiologists with AI to produce fast and accurate medical diagnoses. It communicates with LibreHealth RIS module to output labels on DICOM viewer.\n\nCurrently, CheXnet model is integrated to the AI Model service, but the proposal expands to apply other models to imaging modalities like Mammo, Head CT, Abdomen CT. The project aims to understand what radiologists need in terms of AI and implement it. The goal is to help radiologists perform better by implementing algorithms for new imaging modalities.\n\nTo tackle the problem we start by looking at research that have looked deep into model architectures and methods that work well with imaging modalities, for example Alexnet have proven to work on modalities like Head CT. We then collect the imaging data necessary to train out models and also decide on the method of training like transfer learning on pretrained models or do we go ahead with training a model from scratch. Appropriate feature engineering and tuning will be part of the problem solving process. Once we establish a model to perform well on a modality we proceed to integrate the model to the AI Model service application.\n\nThe deliverables will include\n- Collate information on data sources, methods and models that will be used for implementation and review with mentor(s)\n- For any modality, start with data preparation, feature engineering, training and evaluation until satisfactory performance is achieved. Here we will trial different augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. \n- Integrate the model inferencing code and retraining code to the application for all modalities\n- Add methods to the Flask API to appropriately call the specific AI model for a modality. Modify existing methods as necessary so as to include the new AI models\n- Perform unit tests, integration tests, functional tests and end to end tests for the implementations. Necessary coding standards will be used.",
