VCF files are used to store all variant types which includes single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a specific position of the genome, short insertions and deletions (INDEL) and structural variants (SV). \nVCF-validator includes various checks to ensure that the VCF file is consistent. It is based on a formal grammar and performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis of the VCF file. It also includes a tool called VCF-debugulator which fixes errors such as the presence of duplicate variants automatically. \nSNPs and INDELs are fully supported in VCF-validator, but the support for SVs is still limited. The aim of this project is to improve the support for structural variants in the validator and the debugulator.</p>\n",

These clusters can be in different geographical locations and be managed by different institutions.

First, I will create a \"TES playground\" that is able to run a simple task. Then, I will add to the functionality of this playground in order to demonstrate an implementation of the TES API that can handle a Crypt4GH-encrypted file as an input.
