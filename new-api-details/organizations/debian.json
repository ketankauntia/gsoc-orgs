Debian Stretch, the next Debian stable release, comprises 850 million lines of software source code. Code written in the C programming language accounts for 41% of the lines, which is more than in any other programming language. Debile, Debian’s package analysis platform, so far includes the CppCheck, Clang Static Analyzer, and Coccinelle tools for packages with C, C++, and Objective-C code. However, all of the tools perform static analyses, which can result in false positives. Too many reported false positives hinder adoption of the tools. To address this issue, I propose to integrate the KLEE tool into Debile. KLEE performs dynamic analysis on C programs and reports only true positives, i.e. real bugs. It does so by systematically exploring as many as possible execution paths in a given program. Errors that KLEE reports exist only along feasible execution paths, i.e. they correspond to real bugs in the program.</p>\n",

Recognizing the enormity of packaging the entire Android SDK, the team's focus extends to specific use cases, such as APK analysis tools and simplified setup of standalone components beneficial to non-Android developers, including the Emulator and NDK. Together with projects like Replicant, this endeavor aims to transform Android, the world's most popular operating system, into a fully Free Software platform.\nThe project's deliverables primarily encompass the completion and submission of finalized packages to Debian sid, encompassing both newly created packages and updated ones.

I will identify key functions to benchmark for, and key parameters to benchmark with. Those parameters may be: function input, such as benchmarking for nontrivial data, or for the cluster environment, such as the number of nodes, or implementations of the dependencies (e.g. BLAS), or the allowed deviation from expected benchmark metric (e.g. running time) before a regression is said to occur. Cluster tests will be configured for execution on the Grid5000 network (https://www.grid5000.fr/) in partnership with project mentor and Debian developer Prof. Drew Parsons. The FEniCS suite of packages for finite element computation will be used as a target case study to develop test protocols. The protocols will then be applied to a selection of other parallelised packages.\n\nFinally I will report the information in web pages for ease of consumption.\n\nTo enable more exhaustive testing of Debian parallel packages, I will conduct an audit of the official Debian repository (and online) for keywords that will bring up numerical packages that use parallelism, beyond the set identified above. I will read their documentation and research the problems involved to find the right functions and data to test for, and I will use the initial data gathered during my benchmarks to establish a baseline for which the regression tests will test against in the future. I will consult references for benchmarking numerical packages to make sure my metrics are meaningful. I will use Plotly to produce graphs for the metrics shown in the web page.",

Without them, it's difficult to identify problems early or make sure packages remain functional after updates. This project seeks to enhance quality assurance for these packages by creating and incorporating useful autopkgtests into Debian's CI infrastructure.\n\nI will start by identifying packages that currently have no or limited test coverage. Then, I’ll create and contribute test suites tailored to each package’s functionality. These tests will be run automatically on ci.debian.net, helping catch regressions and keeping packages stable across updates.\n\nI hope to have a number of Debian Med packages under reliable autopkgtests, documentation, and examples by the completion of the project, which can assist other contributors to write such tests in the future.",

Currently, the Debian archive only has PyTorch, but downstream applications are still missing. One of the most promising downstream applications is LLM inference. There are already people working on llama.cpp and Ollama, but vLLM still lacks lots of dependencies to land onto Debian. For multi-GPU inference and concurrency, vLLM has its advantages over llama.cpp. The missing packages are, for instance, transformers, huggingface-hub, etc. This project involves the Debian packaging work for vLLM and its dependencies that are missing from Debian, as well as fixing issues (if there are any) in existing packages to make vLLM work.\nTimelplan\n~ 5/8: Start with the architecture-independent package and non-cuda variant.  \n5/8 ~ 6/1: I will start with the architecture-independent package and non-cuda variant. I already created the package for huggingface-hub so I think this is a good start and doesn't take much time. By this time, I will finish the package for tokenizers packaging.\n6/1 ~ 6/30: Create the package for the transformers package. Then I will finish rest of the package for the vLLM package.\n6/30 ~ 7/18: I will try to build the vLLM package with cuda variant. Now, I already checked that vllm works on CUDA 12.4 so I will try to build the package with CUDA 12.4 with a specific GPU(Maybe T4?). \n7/18: Mid-term evaluation\n7/19 ~ 7/30: Try to build the vLLM package with multiplatform. I will try to build the package with different CUDA versions and different architectures, including a multi-GPU environment. I will get the feedback from the mentor and continue to the next step.\n8/1 ~ 8/25: I will try to finish the project as soon as possible and try to fix the issue. If I have some more time, I will continue with the SGLang packaging.\n8/25 - 9/1: submit final work product.",
