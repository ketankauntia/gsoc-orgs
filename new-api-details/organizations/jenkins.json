This would involve designing and creating the external fingerprint storage API. The API would also allow multiple Jenkins instances to store their fingerprints inside a single external storage instance, enabling traceability of artifacts across the CI/CD flow.

The main point of the project is to simplify the spinning up of the container to run a Jenkins instance with a single command. That’s where Docker-compose comes to the rescue which uses YAML files to spin up multi-container setups. The expected outcomes after completion of the project are an elegant docker-compose file, comprehensive documentation on the workings of these docker-compose files with examples, a Jenkinsfile will be added to ci.jenkins.io with instructions to check the docker-compose files and as these docker-compose files will be able to run on Gitpod we will be able to create a one-click setup for Jenkins using docker and Gitpod.",

Originally started in 2022 as a part of a GSoC project, this tool determines the health score of a plugin. Probes are the heart of the tool. To extend the work started last year, I propose adding new probes to make the tool more valuable and feature-complete. \n\nProject Description\n\nJenkins is an almost two-decade-old open-source project with over 1000 repositories. Plugins bridge the gap between Jenkins and different environments. \nA project as mature and large-scale as Jenkins requires active involvement from active maintainers. \n\nIn general, probes serve two purposes within the context of this toolset: \nTo collect the data to compute the score of the plugin systematically. Based on the computed score, the health of the plugin can be determined.\nBased on the score future contributors, maintainers, and adopters decide which plugin(s) they want to invest their time in. \n\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nDesigning of the probes\nIdentify the key features and functionality of the plugins.\nDefine the metrics that would contribute to the Plugin Health Score.\nThe more probe criteria the plugin meets, the higher the health score of the plugin.\n\nDeciding the probe’s interaction with other probes\n\nDetermining how the probe would contribute to the score.\n\nAdding unit test cases for each probe and scoring implementation. If time permits, I will add integration test cases too.\n\nThe final delivery would be 10 new probes to the Plugin Health Scoring System. \nThese probes will contribute to calculating the overall health of a plugin.\nBy the time the project ends, the tool will approximately have 24 probes in all (10 new + 14 existing probes)\n\nProposed Implementation Plan \n\n- Build each probe, implement it, score it and write its test cases. \n\n- Define interaction of probes with each other.\n\n- Define execution order of each probe.\n\nStretch Goals\n\n- Adding metrics probe\n- Writing integration test cases",

By leveraging data from Jenkins documentation and other relevant sources, the model will be refined to better understand and respond to domain-specific queries. The project involves conducting data preprocessing, fine-tuning the LLAMA model, designing a simple graphical user interface (GUI), and integrating the refined model into the system. Through testing and user feedback, the project aims to ensure the robustness and usability of the system. \nThe deliverables include a system architecture design document, data preprocessing/refining documentation, a user-friendly GUI, a fine-tuned LLAMA2 model, testing reports with results, and a maintenance plan/documentation. \nThe project will empower users to interact with Jenkins knowledge more effectively, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of the software.",

The core task involves fine-tuning an open-source LLM (e.g., Phi-4/Qwen 2.5) on structured data derived from ci.jenkins.io build, logs and metadata, using resource-efficient techniques like QLoRA with Unsloth. To ensure feasibility despite potential API limitations, a primary strategy involves heuristic/manual data curation, supplemented by LLM assistance where possible. A baseline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system incorporating Jenkins documentation will be implemented to enhance factual accuracy. Key deliverables include the fine-tuned model (GGUF for Ollama), a basic FastAPI backend, the RAG pipeline, and an evaluation report incorporating both automated metrics and qualitative mentor feedback",

Most plugins are based on outdated technologies or deprecated APIs, and modernization is a crucial but time-consuming process. The project suggests automating the use of Open Rewrite recipes to modernize plugins, beginning with the creation of a metadata storage system to track modernization efforts and recipe applications. Secure REST APIs will be created to communicate with this metadata to allow easy reading and updates. This modernization metadata will be stored on Jenkins Report Site. The project will also entail automation of the finding and updating of low-scoring health plugins so that there will be an active maintenance approach. Visualization of the progress of modernization will be included in the Jenkins Statistics Site to enable the community to see improvements.  More recipes will be added based on community feedback to provide extensibility.",
