This will allow TensorLy users to switch backends via IVY’s backend handler rather than their own native backend handler.\n\nSet of deliverables are as follows:\n\nImplementing the desired functions in tensorly/backend/ivy_backend.py which will enable users to now use IVY as a framework in TensorLy.\n\nImplementing TensorLy’s abstraction layer (functionalities like Tensor Decomposition, Tensor Regression and Tucker Tensors) by using IVY as the framework.\n\nImplementing new functions into Ivy’s Functional API which exists in TensorLy’s API but currently not present in IVY’s Functional API (for example: context, index_update, ndim, sign, logsumexp, Conj).\n\nCreating demos that demonstrate how the functionalities can be used while building projects using TensorLy when IVY’s backend handler is being used.\n\nRunning tests and implementing benchmarks showcasing the difference in runtime\nperformance.\n\nDocumenting the benchmark evaluations in a notebook for further research.\n\nExtending features with suggestions from the community.",

Developing support of a basic low-level API of GradSLAM (which is independent of other GradSLAM APIs) in Ivy frontend and backend (by implementing missing PyTorch APIs), along with its corresponding ivy tests.\nE.g., gradslam.geometry\n2.) Follow a similar implementation strategy for other independent APIs (gradslam.config) or high-level APIs dependent on gradslam.geometry (Eg: gradslam.datasets, gradslam.structures, gradslam.slam, gradslam.odometry)\n3.) Develop test script same as in official gradslam repo for all APIs.\n4.) Create a tutorial (a jupyter notebook similar to official gradslam notebooks as here) for running GradSLAM using Ivy.\n5.) Lastly, showcase better runtime performance of GradSLAM using JAX as the backend framework.\n\n\nDeliverables:\n-> Multi-backend framework (PyTorch, NumPy, JAX, Tensorflow) support for GradSLAM",
