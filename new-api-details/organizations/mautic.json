          "description": "Currently, Mautic lacks a comprehensive end-to-end test suite, which poses challenges in ensuring the reliability and stability of new changes introduced through pull requests (PRs). Relying solely on user testing for quality assurance often results in bugs being discovered post-release, impacting user experience and trust in the platform.\n\nThis project aims to address these issues by developing a comprehensive end-to-end test suite for Mautic. The suite will cover core functionalities and selected bundles, and it will be run through GitHub Actions as well as locally. This approach enables developers to run the suite locally before making their PRs, ensuring thorough testing and higher code quality.",
