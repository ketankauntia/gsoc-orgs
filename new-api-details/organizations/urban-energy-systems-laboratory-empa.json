Currently, this data is stored in separate platform modules using\ndifferent data structures and file formats, making it difficult to explore holistically. We will migrate this\ndata using a tool Mongify to migrate database from MySQL to MongoDB. The development of server based scripts to automatically extract relevant data from the modules of the HUES platform, and write this data to a common database. In the new database everything can be retrieved in the form of JSON objects. The development of a web-based portal for querying, visualizing and downloading data will be the last part of the project development.</p>\n",

There is a need for a modelling framework that can easily construct and configure systems of modular entities (energy demands, sources, converters, storages and network links). These systems should be hierarchically nestable, facilitating the construction of large systems at high levels of detail. The framework should also facilitate the approximation of sub-systems, to aid model solvability. The above framework should be implemented in an object-oriented fashion, making use of the modular &gt;&gt;Open Energy System Modelling Framework&lt;&lt; (Oemof). Components should be specified in a common format that integrates with a database of available entities. The implementation should allow particular systems to be duplicated and reconfigured as well as reused as subsystems in larger models. Configuration parameters of multiple sub-systems should be readable from an external table.</p>\n",

Solving the full Navier-Stokes equations over a domain the size of a city in 3D would be prohibitively expensive. Fast fluid dynamics (FFD) present an opportunity to solve a simplified version of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations very quickly. In this project I would like to implement FFD to model wind flow through a city, and then apply FFD to solve an optimization problem. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to come with a specific optimization problem, but there are no doubt several that would be interesting.</p>\n",
