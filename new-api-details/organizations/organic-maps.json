However, the built-in planner can only provide one route variant for each route search of a specific way of travel.

So, we need to modify the current planner (with built-in A* algorithm) such that multiple route variants with different features can be generated when the user wants to find a route.\n\nDeliverables: \n1. A full stack implementation of the modified route planner that can generate different routes based multiple different criteria. \n2. A detailed documentation of the features and their mechanisms",
