The primary method through which this synchronization will be done is through syllabic analysis. Applications exist where the number of syllables spoken in an audio file can be extracted without processing the words themselves, resulting in much faster runtimes. By similarly analyzing the number of syllables in a chunk of text, a process for which several very good algorithms exist, we can roughly match the timestamp of each syllable in the audio file to the corresponding syllable in the lyrical text. This process would take place in a separate module than the actual SwagLyric application so as to facilitate speed of retrieval when the user is actually streaming. Several obstacles, which will be discussed in more detail, exist: these include stripping away background music and getting specific audio information from Spotify’s stream.</p>\n",

It is crucial to have version control systems for database in place and hence we need to finalize database migration manager for being future ready for schema changes.</p>\n<p>Another (and the most) important factor are the tests, and at the moment there is very little customisation that can be done. The tests need to have improved comparison, better methods to provide output, improved concurrent and parallel testing and more. A lot of other changes need to be implemented which are mentioned in details in the proposal.</p>\n",

This is an open-source, free, and ad-free project that's built with Flutter.\n\nProposed Deliverables\n\n- A Flutter application that runs as a foreground service and uses Firestore as its database which would hold all the alarms created by the user.\n- This app would allow users to set conditional alarms by tracking their phone activity, location, weather or shared settings.\n- It would also enable users to set up unique challenges such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple mathematical questions of varying difficulty or shaking the phone to dismiss the alarm.\n- Set up end-to-end testing using GitHub Actions to ensure that the application does not break in Android or iOS.\n\nAdditionally, if time permits, I'd also like to work on the following features:\n\n- Implementing some other features such as showing the weather forecast or motivational quotes on the dismissed screen. \n- Making an option to allow users to set quick alarms (alarms relative to the current time, say 10 minutes from now) with intervals (say 6 alarms at an interval of 10 minutes between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM)\n\nPlan of Implementation\n\nTo implement the core functionalities, I will set up the application as a foreground service which will ensure that the alarms set will persist through reboots.\n\nThe unique features such as conditional alarms or dismissal challenges can be implemented using open source packages such as weather, location, and so on.",

Additionally, Docker images for both the backend and frontend will be provided for easy self-hosting and deployment, making the Taskserver production-ready for the Taskwarrior Flutter App.\n\nOther key objectives include implementing Github Actions for the backend and frontend to automate testing on every new commit. Lastly, update CCSync’s documentation, including patch notes and a comprehensive installation guide.",

This approach introduces performance overhead due to frequent subprocess creation and text parsing. The goal of this project is to improve efficiency and maintainability by converting ectool into a shared library and integrating it directly with fw-fanctrl using Python bindings.\n\nI have already implemented a working prototype using ctypes, exposing essential EC functions as shared library calls. During GSoC, I will refine and extend this prototype and expand the shared library to support more ectool functionalities. I will also benchmark and optimize both ectool and fw-fanctrl, and contribute to building a simple cross-platform GUI.\n\nDeliverables include:\n• Full ectool library interface\n• Ectool optimizations\n• Python bindings and integration with fw-fanctrl \n• Fw-fanctrl optimizations\n• fw-fanctrl GUI contribution",
