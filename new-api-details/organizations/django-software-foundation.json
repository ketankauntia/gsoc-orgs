Currently, in order to make partial updates to a JSONField, developers need tol oad model instance to the memory, modify JSONField data as objects, then call save() on the model instance, or write custom mapping for JSON functions as Func subclasses, and use them in update().\n\nIt would be better if Django has built-in support for doing partial JSONField updates more efficiently and more idiomatic to how developers can currently query JSONFields (i.e. with key transforms). In order to achieve that, this proposal intends to create an implementation for all databases supported that developers can use in order to update partial values of JSONField.\n\nThis project aims to accomplish the problem by dividing it into two big parts: first, implement JSONSet and JSONRemove functions to allow partial updates to JSONField. Second, add support for key transforms in update() for JSONField to make it easier to use for developers.\n\nThe project will be executed on creating JSONSet for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle first, then, create JSONRemove on same databases. After that, support for key transform on update() will be implemented.",

This project aims to integrate the core functionality of the popular django-template-partials package into Django itself.\r\nThe solution involves introducing new built-in tags, {% partialdef name %}...{% endpartialdef %} for defining fragments and {% partial name %} for rendering them using the current context (with context modification handled via the standard {% with %} tag). Additionally, template loading functions (get_template, select_template, {% include %}) will be enhanced to support a template_name#partial_name syntax, allowing direct rendering of only the specified fragment. This will leverage Django 5.1's parser.extra_data API for storing compiled partials efficiently.\r\nDeliverables include the implementation of the new tags and nodes, modifications to the template engine's loading mechanism, comprehensive tests, documentation for the new features and loading syntax, and a migration guide for users of the original third-party package.",
