The proposed features are already part of desktop version of the same project, this addition of features to the web project will make both the version look more consistent and improve user experience across both the platforms. The project also proposes the idea of change in user interface of the web project to make it look more mature and responsive.

The modifications suggested by this proposal aims to make user interface clean and make application user friendly.</p>\n",
