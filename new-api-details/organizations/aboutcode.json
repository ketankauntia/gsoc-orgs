The new command line option will enable the user to specify the directories of the licenses and rules that they’d like to use.\n\nThe second part of the approach is modifying ScanCode toolkit internals to work with this new command line option, and to handle the creation and maintenance of indexes for any new license sets. Most of these changes involve refactoring existing methods to take in the directories specified in the command line input, which are then used in generating a LicenseScanner object so that these new licenses are cached properly.",

It will feature tools that identify whether any of the libraries a project is based on have known vulnerabilities. When they have, the system will recommend alternatives that are safer, automatically test them, and create a pull request if the updates are compatible.\n\nAnother area of emphasis is enhancing the way license information is managed—making it more uniform and readable. The project will also assist in identifying third-party code and creating the necessary metadata to provide accurate attribution and license clarity.\n\nNotably, the project also seeks to enhance compliance. It will make automated checks to verify code adheres to license and security policies defined by organizations. If something is amiss, it can alert early during development, keeping teams compliant without additional effort.",
