Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation/operations on ciphertext(encrypted data), generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if it had been performed on the unencrypted data. This can allow critical data to be used by the third party even without letting them know what actually data was and ensuring data privacy.</p>\n<p>So, My proposal is to implement the FV homomorphic encryption scheme inside PySyft library because the algorithms which are natively implemented in PySyft can automatically run across Python, GPUs, Javascript, Android (Kotlin), and iOS (Swift).
