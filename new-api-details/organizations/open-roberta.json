This would be achieved by first simulating multiple obstacles and analysing the optimisation needed to support heavy computation. Further simulating multiple robots with comfortable UI would be done.

One of the robots supported by OpenRoberta is the Lego EV3, and it supports it in two main ways which both require a custom firmware.\nThe problem with this approach is that the process of running a program include many steps and takes a lot of time. A simpler approach is needed, since a faster solution could increase the usage of OpenRoberta with EV3, especially in competitions.</p>\n<h4>Project goal</h4>\n<p>The goal of my project is to enable OpenRoberta to generate UF2 files, which will then be downloaded by the user and copied over the EV3 running the stock firmware. The user will then be able to start the program as if it were a program created with the official Lego Mindstorm IDE.</p>\n",
