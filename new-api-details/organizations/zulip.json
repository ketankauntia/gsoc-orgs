Another very important aspect in software development is testing. With a strong testing infrastructure, the cases of buggy code being patched to production can be reduced a lot. Also the load on committers/reviewers drops down drastically with this as obvious bugs fail to pass the automatic testing phase and alerting the developers that something has gone wrong before they ask for reviews. Through this project we can aspire to improve upon both these aspects and hence result in a big enhancement to the developer experience. This project will involve clearing out various issues relating to enhancement requests tied to these areas as well as developing new tools to support our vision of a better development and testing infrastructure.</p>\n",

The first project in my proposal is to solve this by working in our <strong>Swagger/OpenAPI docs</strong> until we have a 100% documented REST API. The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it, as well as extending our Python bindings to cover all the endpoints the API provides.</p>\n<p>The role that API keys play is also quite important, especially now that our integrations system is becoming more and more robust and we have many different clients for interacting with Zulip.\nThat's why having <strong>multiple API keys per user</strong> could be very useful in terms of user account security and convenience. The second part of my project consists in implementing this feature in Zulip's backend, so normal users can have as many API keys they consider necessary (e.g. one per client), keeping authentication tokens isolated between applications.</p>\n",

By addressing a curated set of issues that have been prioritized by the community and where I already have hands-on experience, I aim to deliver impactful and user-focused enhancements.\n\nKey areas include redesigning and refactoring parts of the settings interface (such as the creation of an Imported Users settings panel, phone number custom profile fields, and making self-role management possible for admins), improving search and filtering capabilities (by adding filters like resolved/unresolved in Inbox and stream filters in Recent Topics), and making Zulip more customizable (e.g., default link preview visibility, hiding spammer emails from non-admins, and flexible name change permissions).\n\nAdditionally, the project involves UI/UX improvements like migrating all buttons to the modern action-button framework and extending the messages_overlay system for advanced message movement interactions.",

This project aims to migrate them to use the Direct Message Group type instead.\n\nThe migration should be seamless with minimal downtime. It involves:\n1. Updating the codebase to support 1:1 DMs using DirectMessageGroup.\n2. Running a backfill migration to create a DirectMessageGroup for each user pair with existing 1:1 messages.\n3. Cleaning up legacy code and adding additional fields that are needed.\n\nThis migration enables per-conversation settings for direct messages, and features like pinning or hiding DM conversations can be implemented more easily.",
