My solution involves implementing hash maps for faster lookups, refactoring network selection, improving evaluation with SIMD instructions, batched inference, and improving inverse regression with literature-backed starting points. The project will be delivered through two main pull requests: the first focused on an improved data-driven tutorial with step-by-step guides and troubleshooting resources, and the second containing the optimized source code implementation and comprehensive benchmarking results, making data-driven approaches more accessible and efficient for all users.",

Key outputs like lift, drag, and pressure coefficients will be visualized and stored for regression tracking. These validation tests will be integrated into SU2’s CI pipeline, enabling automatic execution, reporting, and performance benchmarking. Additional efforts include modularizing unit tests, improving test coverage, and providing clear documentation for future contributors.
