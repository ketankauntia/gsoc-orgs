PEcAn already has an interface with Shiny (R) for visualizations and the main aim of this project would be to work upon the existing Shiny apps as well as developing other powerful visualizations to convey the right amount of information as well as clear understanding to the users on the platform. For me, an important component of this project is to understand what kind of visualization would give an intuitive sense to any user given the data and to present them in a very clear and effective manner. Otherwise, the user could not draw inferences that we want to show them.

To simplify this process, the PEcAn team would benefit from an application that can download datasets from any data federation, and parse the metadata so that it can be automatically read into PEcAn. To help further them in this direction, I will create an ingest workflow for a single data federation, DataOne, as a proof of concept. This app will be able to resolve data by doi. I will also add drag and drop functionality to facilitate downloading data from unsupported data federations. This app will then facilitate the process of selecting the correct semantics necessary in order to ingest data into BETYdb (the PEcAn database) by walking the user through this complex process. This app will also serve future development by creating a probability distribution of the semantics selected by the users. This distribution can be used to train a machine learning algorithm that will suggest semantic selection with greater accuracy in the future.</p>\n",

The coarse resolution of PEcAn's current outputs limits their applicability for localized analyses of carbon dynamics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (STRNNs), this project will enhance the accuracy and granularity of PEcAn's model outputs, enabling more detailed analyses to support ecosystem management and climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nThe project will involve developing a robust data preparation pipeline to handle diverse covariate datasets, including climate variables, land cover, soil properties, and disturbance history. Time-varying covariates and disturbance events will be integrated to capture their influence on carbon flux dynamics. Tailored CNN and STRNN architectures will be designed and implemented to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Comprehensive model training, evaluation, and optimization strategies will be employed to ensure accurate downscaling performance.\n\nThe developed models and workflows will be seamlessly integrated into the existing PEcAn framework, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for researchers and practitioners. User-friendly interfaces, command-line tools, and comprehensive documentation will facilitate the adoption and usage of the downscaling capabilities.\n\nThe key deliverables include a scalable data preparation pipeline, optimized CNN and STRNN architectures for downscaling, model training and evaluation pipelines, evaluation metrics , and the integration of the developed solution into the PEcAn framework with user-friendly interfaces and documentation.",

The goal is to create ensemble-ready inputs that enable sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. As a stretch goal, the project will implement an integrated workflow that runs the SIPNET model over these ensembles and performs variance partitioning to quantify the contribution of each data source to model output uncertainty. \nCurrent variance decomposition in PEcAn only supports parameter uncertainty. This project aims to address this gap by developing modular data preparation workflows that propagate and analyze uncertainty from multiple sources—including parameter, meteorological data, soil data and vegetation initial conditions. \nDeliverables include reusable R functions, data preparation modules, documentation, and example workflows integrated into the PEcAn system.",

Currently, PEcAn uses one-at-a-time methods that overlook interactions between key inputs such as meteorology, soils, and vegetation. By integrating Sobol’ sensitivity analysis, this project will automate the process of uncertainty partitioning across multiple inputs, improving climate impact assessments in both natural and managed ecosystems.\n\nThe approach involves refactoring an existing Sobol’ prototype code into PEcAn's core ensemble workflow, automating sensitivity analysis, and validating the system with real-world case studies. The key deliverables include an automated Sobol' workflow integrated into PEcAn, validation reports for case studies (ED2 and SIPNET), comprehensive documentation, and successful pull requests for code integration.",

The solution involves auditing current modules (query.traits.R, query.yields.R, query.citations.R, etc.) to identify database-dependent components, and systematically refactoring them to support alternative data sources like CSV, JSON, or lightweight SQLite databases.\nAdditionally, tools will be developed for syncing offline results back to BETYdb when needed, preserving compatibility. \nKey deliverables include a standalone trait dataset, workflow execution independent of PostgreSQL, improved module interoperability, and documentation updates to support adoption. This work will significantly improve PEcAn’s accessibility, portability, and usability across a broader set of environments and users.",
