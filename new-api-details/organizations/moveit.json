Personally, I would extend the benchmark package so that it could be used by the Benchmark Suite and also by everyone who wants to do benchmarks. Additionally, the trajectories should also be kept so that someone could visualize the trajectory. The seed used in sampling based planners should also be kept. This could be used directly to compare two collision detection algorithms and also for benchmarking CHOMP as a post-processor. We could also do benchmarks on different mesh qualities. I think MTC could be used to setup benchmark easily by adding the desired scenes, start pose and end goal or path constraints in the database in one click.</p>\n",

However, there is still plenty of work to do before this feature is mature enough and compatible with MoveIt's mainstream branch.\nConcrete steps: \n1) Use MoveIt's code standards. \n2) Address the compatibility issue. Define a workflow to allow users to use this new feature without enforcing it on everyone. \n3) Optimize our previous approach to make it faster and safer to use with robots moving at high speeds. \n4) Document the approach, as well as, generate test cases for MoveIt's Continuous Integration system.",
