          "description": "This is a biparted project in which we first focus on integrating Apache Arrow into OpenMS’s build system and dependency management framework, as simple as that sounds. The goal here is to ensure a solid foundation by creating custom CMake scripts, updating CI pipelines, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. In the second phase, we will implement a converter that transforms mzML files into the Arrow-compatible Parquet format. This conversion not only preserves the integrity of the original data and also allows for the leveraging of the richer schema evolution and querying capabilities of Parquet. Together, these efforts form the ARROW project, ultimately paving the way to more efficient computational mass spectrometry workflows.",

By reducing GPU-CPU transfers and removing redundant steps, I've cut its function run time by about 180 times. Next, I plan to add parallel and container-friendly setups so it can handle even larger loads across multiple machines. My final deliverables include code changes, tests, and documentation, helping researchers run analyses faster and more reliably.",
