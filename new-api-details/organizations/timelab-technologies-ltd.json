Impulse responses are useful as they enable us to link the variability properties with emission properties and subsequently, observe the X-ray spectrum.</p>\n<p>The end-goal of this project is to implement a fully-working time series simulator with working unit tests and complete documentation. The end-goal also includes comparing the properties of simulated time series against real data.</p>\n",

Displaying data graphically in form of plots, helps in quickly viewing the most important aspects of the given data and helps in finding the patterns and trends hidden in the Data . Project involves performing series of operations on the data , and produce interactive plots out of it , for analysis .</p>\n",
