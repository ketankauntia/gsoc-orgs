A substantial part of this undertaking is to port a majority of the code base to Python 3. This involves porting the individual modules and sub–modules piece by piece, where the whole process will be guided by <em>unit tests</em>. In the beginning, I will remove all tests from the pipeline that do not pass for Python 3 and take this pared–down code base as a starting point, porting parts of the code and putting the respective unit tests back in as I go along. Missing unit tests must be added before moving on. Since porting Python 2 code to Python 3 code is a standard problem for the Python community, there are many different tools available that can help in this regard. In addition to that, I'd like to extend this project to a bit of a <em>Hausmeister</em> project (<em>housekeeping</em> for Pattern), and optimize/modernize the code base in terms of <em>execution speed</em>, <em>memory usage</em> and <em>documentation</em>.</p>\n",
