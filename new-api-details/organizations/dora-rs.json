It involves building a modular MuJoCo simulation for robotic arms, implementing a Dora data collection node in the LeRobot format, and generating diverse manipulation datasets. The collected data will be documented, open-sourced on HuggingFace, and supported by beginner-friendly tutorials and demos to showcase real-world applications. Deliverables include simulations, a data collection tool, a sample dataset, documentation, tutorials, and a public dataset release.",

It is necessary to combine it with dora.\n\nRecently, support for the SO-ARM100, a low-cost robotic arm, was added to Dora through its driver. However, there is currently no end-to-end tutorial available for using this arm. Tutorials and documentation are critical for making the project more accessible to new users.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve the Python-based tutorial for using the SO-ARM100 robotic arm with Dora-LeRobot, enabling users to easily get started and contribute to the ecosystem.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n1.Fix issues and add missing code so that Dora-LeRobot can be run with SO-ARM100 successfully.\n2.Writing detailed setup and usage tutorials.\n3.Implementing code for calibration, control, training, and inference.\n4.Creating video tutorials and improve based on community feedbacks.\n5.Creating test plan for user testing to ensure the tutorial is easy to follow.\n6.Developing the Rust library for UR5 control. A well-documented, efficient, and effective Rust library that interfaces with UR5 robots through Dora.",
