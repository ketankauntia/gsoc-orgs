This is important as user need to brows through the all the existing models which are the part of the repository and download only selective models. A structured local storage will not only also allow users to easily add their own models to the local library management system, but also to the online repository open to public. For maintaining the metadata of these, a well defined storage structure is required.\nAll this need to have an proper interface to be operable. The interface for the above will be developed as both a Graphical Interface and module for python scripting.",

This is done by attaching a probe to the tool head of the machine and scanning the surface of the finalised product to see if there are discrepancies between the expected result and actual measurements. \n\nIncluding such a tool on FreeCAD, which already has a dedicated set of tools for CNC milling in the Path Workbench, will not only bring it closer to proprietary solutions but even surpass some of them that don't have this feature. This would save time for the machinist and also increase the inherent accuracy of the whole process.\n\nBuilding upon this, sensing solutions can introduce novel approaches to improve the CAM workflow and even generate new solutions not seen before. This proposal argues for an automatized post-processing of, for example, 3D prints by milling them to correct tolerances and inherent defects of the manufacturing process like layer patterns, over-extrusion or limited resolution. \n\nFor On-machine inspection, there are already commercial solutions available so it's a matter of replicating their implementations on Python for FreeCAD. For the post-processing tool, a more involved overview of optimization algorithms for closely-matching volumes will be needed but it's surely available in the literature. If not, my background in mathematics and physics should prove valuable in the development of such an algorithm.\n\nThus, the main goals for the proposal are to prodive the FreeCAD Path Workbench with two new tools, On-machine Inspection and automatized post-processing of already manufactured pieces, and also to properly test and document these new tools in the FreeCAD wiki.",

Currently, FreeCAD users must rely on complex multi-step workflows involving external tools like MeshLab, LaTeX, or even commercial CAD software to create 3D PDFs, often resulting in loss of model fidelity, colors, and structure.\n\nThis project proposes implementing a seamless 3D PDF export feature integrated directly into FreeCAD's TechDraw workbench. Users will be able to create standard technical drawings with traditional orthographic views and dimensions, plus an interactive 3D view that appears as a regular isometric view in print but becomes fully interactive when viewed digitally.\n\n\nKey components of the implementation include:\n1.\tDocument Structure Access: Utilizing FreeCAD's Python API to traverse the document object hierarchy or need to rely on Qt for accessing certain structural information. \n2.\t3D Format Conversion: Implementing exporters for both U3D format and PRC format to support NURBS surfaces for higher fidelity representation.\n3.\tPDF Generation: Creating a PDF container that properly embeds the 3D content with interactive viewing capabilities.\n4.\tTechDraw Integration: Extending the TechDraw workbench to include a new \"3D View\" type alongside traditional orthographic views.\n\nThe completed feature will significantly enhance FreeCAD's usability for professional documentation, enabling users to share interactive 3D models with clients and collaborators who don't have CAD software, addressing a long-requested feature within the FreeCAD community.",
