It lets other users see if a particular implementation solves their purpose while also serving as a 'portfolio' for the researchers.</p>\n<p>By the end of the summer, users will be able to search for various demos published by various researchers and thus be able to find an implementation that suits their needs the best. Additionally, Origami will also support REST APIs. This will allow Origami to be used to provide some infrastructure  for chat bots which can then be integrated with Slack, Facebook, etc. Origami will also be integrated with EvalAI to allow users to compare their implementation with that of their competitors. Finally, Origami will support other features such as allowing users to upload to/from Dropbox, releasing anonymous demos, a better CMS and predefined templates to create apps to name a few.</p>\n",

The chatbot will efficiently address queries related to challenge hosting, guidelines, troubleshooting, and FAQs. \nBy integrating state-of-the-art NLP techniques with robust retrieval mechanisms, the solution will ensure prompt, accurate, and context-aware responses that reduce support overhead and streamline communication.\nUsing the RAG approach, the chatbot will retrieve relevant information from challenge documentation and combine it with generative models to create coherent and helpful answers. This will empower hosts to manage challenges more effectively and assist participants in resolving queries, ultimately contributing to a smoother and more interactive challenge experience.\n\n\nDeliverables include :\nRAG Framework Implementation\nChat UI\nComprehensive Documentation\nTesting, Feedback, and Continuous Improvement",
