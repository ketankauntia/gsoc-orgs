Then the existing compilation pipeline can be reused to produce JavaScript code from the IR. The key to this project is that, as complex as it may be, it would reuse a lot of great code.

Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",

          "description": "The current state of the asynchronous I/O on the JVM involves using separate selector threads to manage I/O events through system functions like epoll or kqueue. Although frameworks like Netty and NIO2 make this approach seem reasonable, the use of separate event loop threads is not without cost. In high-RPS services, these threads can compete for CPU time with worker threads executing application tasks, leading to resource contention and potentially significant performance loss. In contrast, Cats Effect offers a different threading model, integrating I/O and application tasks into a single runtime system, reducing contention an enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nio_uring, the key component of this project, offers two major advantages: (1) it enables all supported syscalls to become asynchronous from the application’s perspective, allowing for multiple syscalls to be initiated in parallel without blocking the calling thread, and (2) it uses a pair of ring buffers for syscall submission and completion events that are shared between the application and the kernel, dramatically reducing the overhead of calling from userspace into kernelspace. When integrated with Cats Effect, io_uring can significantly improve the efficiency of syscalls, requiring fewer calls into kernelspace during the worker loop. \n\nThis proposal brings two key innovations together: a new threading model and a new I/O API. By integrating Cats Effects and FS2 with io_uring, we aim to develop an alternative solution to minimize the inefficiencies found in the traditional model, offering a more efficient and performant solution for I/O-intensive applications.",

The API should be flexible and extensible, allowing users to easily add new types of plots, customize the appearance and layout, and apply different data transformations. To achieve these goals, we will use the tagless final style and composition, which enables us to combine multiple interfaces.\n2) Graph Adjustments Support: these features can help improve the clarity and usefulness of the plots and graphs we create. These features include axis limits, line width, marker style, transparency, color scheme, legends, annotations, axis scale, aspect ratio, etc.\n3) Documentation: in addition to written documentation, we will provide visual examples and demos that are extremely helpful in illustrating how to use the API.

Doodle supports differences between backends through its tagless final architecture. \n\nDoodle currently supports retained mode graphics. Retained mode graphics involve representing the image as a data structure, creating a hierarchy of elements where each element relates to others. While this facilitates expressing parts of the image in terms of others, it poses challenges with large numbers of elements, making alignment difficult and memory usage proportional to the number of elements. On the other hand, immediate mode graphics represent the image as a function for drawing it. This method consumes memory proportional to the algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov complexity) of describing the image. In immediate mode, we can have a single drawing context and can be used for high volume graphics. This enhancement will allow for more interactive experiences, opening up new possibilities for creative expression and application development. Further on, we wish to add advantages of the immediate mode, while retaining the advantages of retained mode. Combining both the methods can be very crucial for the developer willing to involve both the modes in a single method.",

The Workflow4s Chat Toolkit solves this by providing a lightweight Scala library that abstracts these complexities behind a simple, unified interface.\n\nThe solution delivers:\n\nPlatform adapters with core messaging capabilities (send/receive)\n\nWorkflow4s integration points for chat-triggered automations\n\nType-safe Scala design using Futures and case classes\n\nMock testing environment for reliable development\n\nKey deliverables include:\n\nPhase 1: Slack MVP with basic messaging and workflow triggers\n\nPhase 2: Production-ready error handling and workflow actions\n\nPhase 3: Extensible architecture documentation and multi-platform support\n\nThe toolkit significantly reduces integration overhead, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than API specifics. By implementing this as a prototype first, we validate the approach while laying foundation for future expansion to richer interactions like file sharing and threaded conversations.

These telemetry signals are exported in Prometheus and Jaeger-compatible formats and processed through the OpenTelemetry Collector. The data is then visualized on a unified Grafana dashboard, allowing developers to monitor performance, debug errors, and analyze execution flows across different LLM providers in real-time.",
