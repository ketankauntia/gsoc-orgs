It provides simple classes and methods to perform wide range of things like signing files using private key of user, export certificates, import certificates, verify signature, generating public and private keys, etc. User will be uploading his script on server, from where remote users can directly access such scripts through code and verify them before execution to know their credibility.

To answer the needs of automotive industry in this manner with an open-source approach, recent studies have been made such as the Eclipse-based APP4MC platform. Although APP4MC provides sufficient tooling in parallel computing for automotive domain, the demonstration and evaluation of its results would improve its performance and allow to investigate the optimization of goals such as resource usage and energy consumption. With the project, software distribution challenges for such automotive systems should be analyzed upon instruction precise modeling, affinity constrained distribution, and reducing task response times achieved by advanced software parallelization.

The Best Trace Format (BTF) provides the specification for tracing\nthe tasks and events which are based on the OSEK architecture.\nThis project aims at developing a tracing framework based on the BTF specification to generate trace\non Real Time Parallella Framework. The generated trace file can be viewed on external tools such as\nEclipse Trace Compass to analyse task events occurring on the processor core.

The current version of 4diac IDE does not support the validation of the models, which makes it difficult for users to get design-time feedback on inconsistencies regarding the models developed in 4diac. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) could be a solution to find issues in 4diac models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill.

To detect faults early, modeling implicit assumptions within IEC 61499 software can provide the basis for automated checks. Such assumptions are typically described in constraint languages, which are difficult to use by automation experts.

It has also become apparent that the automated tests need to be more stable, as the 4diac IDE is constantly being extended and improved and some tests that ran last year are no longer running due to these changes.\nTherefore, these tests need to be more stable and also easily adaptable. \n\nAn important step in this regard will be that the tests will no longer rely on hard-coded coordinates, but will be able to search for elements by ID.
