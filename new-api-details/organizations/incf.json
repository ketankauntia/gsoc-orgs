As a result, most of the single cell and neural network models have low RAPT (reproducibility, accessibility, portability and transparency). This has slowed the progress of using biophysically and anatomically detailed neural network models in understanding the brain function in health and disease. In a period of three months during the GSoC placement, I would like to contribute to the Open Source Brain (OSB) Initiative which aims to increase the RAPT of single cell and neural network models. The project will extend the initial work by the OSB on converting the thalamocortical network model by Traub et al. (2005) to the simulator-independent model format, NeuroML2. Firstly, I propose to annotate and implement the tests for spiking behaviour of Traub model cells which are converted to the NeuroML2 format. Secondly, I propose to create a generic Python-based package which can generate different configurations of cortical networks in the NeuroML2 format  and combine unique network components from different cortical network projects.</p>\n",

Recurrent Neural Networks offer an attractive method for simulating, replicating, and characterizing these circuits. PyDSTool currently supports simulation of neural circuity dynamics and linear methods of dimensionality reduction such as Principle Component Analysis for normalizing complex data; however, such methods are insufﬁciently tailored to working with non-linearly distributed data. I propose the implementation of a module targeted at providing non-linear dimensionality reduction via Sammon mappings, principal curves, and locally linear embeddings. In addition, I will create tools in Fovea that will allow for the intuitive visualization of datasets resolved by these methods.</p>\n<p>I also seek to provide a suite of tools to PyDSTool for constructing and training Recurrent Neural Networks and corresponding solutions for visualizing the operation, feedback mechanisms, network structure, and dynamical systems characteristics (e.g. attractors) of these models.</p>\n",

One method to do this is through trial and error, where a researcher sets the input parameters to specific values based upon their experience, and collects the outputs as sample points to investigate later on (Sedlmair et al.).

The latter functionality will have major benefits for the speed with which large simulations in Brian can run.\nThis is because it allows the use of larger timesteps for the overhead loops in Python, without losing\n(likely even improving) the accuracy of the numerical integration at points where small timesteps\nare necessary.

Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB.

Publication of biological data is often weakly structured and has no standardised format making assimilation challenging. Currently PyOpenWorm acts as a quick data access layer for researchers to query C. elegans anatomy and physiology. It currently incorporates data from the primary literature, WormAtlas and WormBase. This project would aim to expand the data available for model validation and for query in PyOpenWorm. Expanding the data available would aid hypothesis generation in the C.elegans research community, by allowing fast access to past observations and by facilitating the generation of more robust models through model validation tests such as SciUnit. However, ultimately it could also be a poster child to inspire an increase in standardisation and statistical accountability in the publication of biological research as a whole. As an additional project, we will start work to create \"Standard Worm\" which will enable researchers to compare variability in experimental worms to a standard reference space.</p>\n",

With a plethora of different sets of governing equations, neuronal models with complex biophysical properties, synapses with plasticity and parameters, a mechanism to derive generalized platform-independent model description becomes inevitable. Further, the model description mechanism helps in easy access and reproduction of the models, and thereby exasperating reference to the platform-specific source code shall be avoided. Currently, Brian uses <code>brian2tools.nmlexport</code> package to elegantly export Brian models to <code>NeuroML</code>. However, it is confined and cannot be extended easily to various other generalized model descriptors. Therefore, the project proposes an idea to create a generalized basic framework, which can coherently describe Brian models in a standard format and shall be easily extended to various other formats. The proposed idea would substantially enhance the interfacing functionality of Brian models with other standard model descriptors and thereby helps various users and research communities.</p>\n",

However, the fMRI data modeling performed by TVB suffers from the drawback of considering a standard model for the underlying Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), throughout a brain and across various brain models. Several studies have indicated that HRF shows variability across both the subjects and across various brain regions of a particular subject. To account for the same, we aim at extending the rsHRF-toolbox  to interface between estimating region-specific resting-state HRF (rsHRF) from fMRI data, and modeling BOLD activity in TVB. The extended toolbox shall take fMRI data as input, estimate the region-specific rsHRF for regions (network nodes) defined by the connectome used in TVB, and mediate the fMRI data simulations through TVB's Bold monitor and BoldRegionROI monitor while accounting for the underlying HRF variability across the network. We also aim to build a GUI interface for the toolbox and consequently a docker implementation for the same as we expect end-users from various communities and backgrounds.</p>\n",

We want to provide a general analysis and statistical tools so that researchers around the world can use these tools for their analysis. This includes the ability to incorporate new forms of analysis as well as algorithms for new types of data. The ability to extract quantitative data from the movie images is key to conducting comparative and time-series analysis. A dashboard will give researchers an edge to easily see their results and interpret them.\nThis project will help the organization to compile its resources as well as to spread its cause i.e. - an attempt to build the first virtual organism.</p>\n",

A natural extension of this model was proposed in a paper by Joglekar et. al . Instead of using non-linear firing rate models, the cortical area was simulated as a spiking neuronal network. This was extremely useful to investigate the propagation of activity in the synchronous and asynchronous regime of the network. My goal in this project is to convert this model to PyNN allowing the simulation in several simulators.  As a secondary goal in this project, I would like to convert the model proposed by Demirtas et. al.   that is a large-scale circuit model of human cortex incorporating regional heterogeneity in microcircuit properties inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for parametrization across the cortical hierarchy and fitting models to resting-state functional connectivity.</p>\n",

Although developed for MRI originally, it has gained popularity within the EEG and MEG realms. Converting raw data to the BIDS standard is not difficult but requires a lot of time if done by hand. Currently software like mne-bids and Biscuit are available to assist and facilitate this conversion but there is still no automated way to produce a valid BIDS dataset for the EEG and MEG use-cases. Mostly what is missing is metadata. Here a python package is proposed to be able to infer the missing information from files accompanying the EEG and MEG files and/or a single bids-conversion example provided by the user. The idea of having human-readable configuration files is also explored since this would help the sharing of common conversion parameters within similar communities. If this proposal was successfully implemented then batch conversion of BIDS datasets in the EEG and MEG cases would be realized. It is hoped that this package becomes the backend of an hypothetical web application that assists this conversion of MEG-EEG datasets.</p>\n",

This project is an important step in addressing this challenge. The goal of this project is to convert publicly available datasets to the standardized NeuroData Without Borders (NWB) format so that they can be better interpreted and reused by other researchers. The data will then be made available for interactive analysis and visualization through the NWB explorer on the Open Source Brain repository. By using a standardized data format, researchers can more quickly work with new data and develop analysis methods to apply to a wide variety of datasets. The ability to easily explore and visualize data will also allow researchers to quickly assess the contents of the data and if they can reuse it.

We have an existing database of publicly available labeled EEG/MEG datasets, tools in both Python for time series classification and collaborators who are experts in traditional techniques for analyzing EEG/MEG.

Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. \nHowever, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. \nIn its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user.

While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web.

NWB has thus exemplified as a sustainable biological data ecosystem, but there lies the need of converting readily available datasets into NWB format to allow for further sharibility and producibility. With that said, this project aims to (i) convert a publically available dataset into NWB format, (ii) ensure NWB datasets' compatibility with NWB explorer (NWBE), (iii) and facilitate generality of the conversion process by investigating the sources of NWBE-NWB incompatibilities and ensuring essential metadata being added. This is a medium size project (175h).",

Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired.\nDiffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important. This study sheds light on this issue by proposing examples on how to improve the code, such as an optimization of Subvoxel-Triangle intersection algorithm, Ray-Triangle intersection algorithm, and the way of saving triangles and an implementation of a new feature that could allow the simulation of more complex systems.",

To validate the model, I will compare the results of PyGeNN simulations to those of BMTK/NEST simulations. Finally, I will construct an application that simulates V1 activity in response to a webcam stream in real time. If time permits, I will enhance this application by implementing a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet LGN model, which will increase the maximum frame rate that can be simulated in real time. \n\nThe results of this project will include: (1) a complete model of mouse V1, (2) validation results and benchmark comparisons to BMTK/NEST simulations, (3) a webcam application showing simulated neural activity in real time, and (4) if time permits, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet model.",

          "description": "This project aims to add brain imaging data structure (BIDS) provenance to a workflow engine written in Python called ‘Pydra’. The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",

The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors.\n\nThe aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization\n2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used\n3. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that the new features become accessible from the graphical user interface\n4. Thoroughly test the newly implemented features and their integration with existing features of Neuroptimus",

Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example.\n\nThis project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data. The primary goal of this project is to develop Python utilities for augmenting event camera recordings of objects captured in an academic setting in various ways to create benchmark datasets. A secondary goal of this project is to test the performance of spiking neural networks for object recognition on the created datasets.",

However, PMC requires full-text machine-readable XML article file deposits. These files contain the complete article text in machine-readable language, with front-matter metadata. At the moment, final paper submissions to NBDT are in LaTeX format. While there are tools that provide LaTeX to XML conversion (as required by PMC), no single tool does it seamlessly without errors for the template corresponding to NBDT. The current project aims to build an application providing this functionality. The project will build over the LaTeXML tool to enhance custom bindings as required for NBDT submissions. The first step would be to enhance the bindings for body matter, as Scholastica (which hosts NBDT) already provides it for front-matter binding. In addition, to make the application platform-independent, it will be extended to provide custom front-matter and back-matter bindings. It shall also contribute verification engines to automate XML verification, JATS verification, and PMC-specific verification. The application shall make it convenient to bridge NBDT submissions and the PMC archival process.",

The open-source parameter optimization software Neuroptimus was developed to enable easy application of  advanced parameter optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence, to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers. While Neuroptimus uses various built-in cost functions and the eFEL feature extraction library to compare model behavior to experimental data, it severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by optimization. However, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows for the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend Neuroptimus to use HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit, to evaluate model performance during optimization. This project aims to develop a seamless integration between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus, enabling the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons. The new Neuroptimus-HippoUnit integration will allow the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, which can ultimately lead to improved biophysical models of hippocampal neurons.\nDeliverables: \n1- Implementation of an interface between HippoUnit and the new version of Neuroptimus to enable the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors.\n2- Extend the current supported tests to include all HippoUnit tests.\n3- Integrate the HippoUnit with the Neuroptimus’s GUI so that users can run optimizations directly from the interface.",

A hallmark of schizophrenia is a reduction in ASSR; this project aims at reproducing this phenomenon using an auditory cortex (A1) model with thalamocortical connectivity. The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Specifically, we aim at reproducing results from an experiment looking at the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1, so that I will be able to use a personal computer, but I may employ cloud resources as well.Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox. Afterwards, we will move to parameter optimization of the A1 model so that it reproduces the ASSR, using the Optuna HPO toolkit. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the ASSR phenomenon in the A1 model. For every step of the process, documentation will be made available on a deployed site.",

We will achieve this by creating a text editor page where users can add content, edit content, remove content, add tables, and add images. The text editor should allow users to add latex code so that users can publish mathematical analyses of the findings.

However, they use machine learning methods that have been overtaken by recent Deep Learning innovations, and therefore limit the studies that can be carried out on musical creativity and sound/movement interaction. The aim of this project is to use these modern Deep Learning methods to generate music driven by motion capture. The framework consists of 3 distinct modules. Firstly, user gestures are detected using landmarks generated by MediaPipe by Google. Secondly, these landmarks are used to recognize the gesture performed by the user, and generate Open Sound Control (OSC) signals. Finally, the OSC signals are converted into music using Max/MSP. In addition, new gestures can be dynamically added to the framework, with just a few examples, and mapped to new sounds.\nDeliverables:\n- Experiment to estimate the appropriate delay between a gesture and the resulting sound/effect.\n- Framework based on LivePose or Pose2Art using only the gestures predifined in MediaPipe, able to interface the chosen camera and the sound-card\n- Model based on MediaPipe holistic model to classifiy dynamic gestures\n- Famework to map gestures to sounds through OSC signals.\n- Few-Shot Learning-based model to dynamically add new gestures",

It uses two special tools called Spatial Hypergraphs and Lineage Hypergraphs to map out and understand these interactions. Spatial Hypergraphs look at how cells are arranged and interact in space, which helps us understand how they communicate and influence each other. Lineage Hypergraphs track the family tree of each cell, showing how cells evolve and form different parts of the worm's body. By combining these tools, the project aims to get a complete picture of the worm's development, from a single cell to a fully formed organism. This work could help us learn more about basic life processes and improve medical and tissue engineering fields. The project is supported by international organizations interested in neuroscience and the use of advanced computer models to study brain and nervous system development.",

Thus, this framework will represent open-source communities as a system composed of interconnected components (agents), mapping the intricacies of community engagement and collaboration as well as focusing on emergent properties and overall system behaviour.  \n     \nThis project is important to the open-source ecosystem because as the demand for open-source software continues to grow, so do the challenges associated with community management, collaboration, and sustainability.

The Allen Institute provides a powerful API that allows users to programmatically access and retrieve data. First through data cleaning, and then through data crawling to obtain data that is difficult to access in the API. In addition, domain-specific language models will be fine-tuned or trained using Google's Gemini model for subsequent data acquisition.\nParameter Conversion: Develop tools(scripts) or design large language model prompts to automatically convert extracted data into a parameter format understood by the NetPyNE, such as .hoc or .swc format. Identify how to set reasonable default values for missing data.\nModel construction: Use the converted parameters to construct neural network models of relevant brain regions in NetPyNE. This includes defining neuron types, neuron connectivity, and synaptic interactions between neurons.\nRun Simulation: Run a simulation of the model in NetPyNE to simulate the brain's response to a specific input stimulus.\nCompare Results: Compare the simulation results with actual biological experimental data to verify the accuracy of the model.\n\nIntended set of deliverables:\nAutomated Data Collection Tool.\nParameter Conversion Script.\nSimulation Run Framework.\nResult Validation Report.\nDocumentation and User Guide.",

Additionally, a wider variety of captivating stimuli, both visual and auditory, will be incorporated to keep infants engaged during testing. The core functionality, eye-tracking, will be significantly improved by exploring advanced deep learning techniques. This will enable precise gaze estimation in all directions, including up and down, providing a more complete picture of an infant's visual attention. Furthermore, a novel test will be developed to identify potential vision issues associated with anisometropic amblyopia. Finally, the system will be designed for seamless integration with various external eye-tracking hardware devices, increasing its flexibility and applicability.

What if we want to find optimal parameter value, given a particular set of dataset. Why is this even required? The very simple answer to this can be found in every modelling and computation textbook. We cannot necessarily measure the other parameters. Let us take an example:\n There are several parameters while defining a neuron whose measurement is difficult to make, for example the axial resistance, the capacitance of the soma etc. Thus to achieve this process we make use of 2 tools, the first is the neuron library which is used for designing your neuron model and setting your parameters ,secondly is a statistical measurement tool used for the parameter estimation .This is done by checking for the voltage value generated by the neuron model and what might the parameter values be for that particular value.\nThe reason to utilize Bayesian inference for parameter estimation is due to the specification of the prior data ,which will help us to increase the accuracy of our model which predicts approximate parameter values. Now the user could specify the prior data on the basis of any previous study or research material.\nNeuroptimus is an open source tool created for the same purpose. It is an interactive tool where the user can drop a dataset file. Train it and use it for parameter estimation .\nI have been tasked to utilize the prior ,the noise (for the calculation of likelihood),and the evidence to find the posterior distribution of the parameter I want to estimate. This is the main gist of the project, but there are various hurdles such as what if it is difficult to find the likelihood ,type of noise, computational costs for multiple parameters etc. These are some other things I believe I will be working on.",

High-quality data annotations require domain expertise, so that annotations are relevant, but also specific technical skills, such as knowing how to handle JSON/XML files. Additionally, people are often reluctant to change their workflows, and the technical affordances in the case of data annotation intensify this challenge. As a result, researchers tend to stick to their “data handling traditions” as soon as data operations become too complex. Unfortunately, this often means that even though projects like Neurobagel are working hard to make life easier for researchers, these tools are not widely adopted. \n\nMy idea for contributing to the Neurobagel project is to combine a user-friendly interface with a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to make the annotation of tabular data even more effortless for researchers. For the end user, the process should be to provide a tabular file and get a first-pass annotation for review without any intermediate steps. From a technical perspective, this should be accomplished by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to categorize columns, such as participant ID or age. To improve the predictions of the LLM, already annotated data will be linked to explicit knowledge from existing ontologies such as SNOMED CT or the Cognitive Atlas and used to provide context for the LLM.",

          "description": "Traditionally, brain activity has been analyzed independently from peripheral physiological measurements like the electrocardiogram (ECG), but our understanding of brain-heart interactions (BHI) has significantly evolved since then: we now know that not only does the brain modulate the heart but surprisingly the heart exerts a powerful influence on the brain. For example, the timing of a learning task relative to the cycle of the heartbeat modulates its event-related potential (ERP), and heart-beats interact with activity in the insula, an area critically involved in internal monitoring. However, despite this increased interest in BHI in the neuroscientific community, there is a lack of well-documented tool, that incorporates much of the modern BHI identification techniques, treats sensitively ECG artifacts, and furthermore complements modern brain connectivity analysis. BHI studies point to a much greater complexity in neural signals that current connectivity packages fail to account for, such as recent work pointing to the modulating of brain oscillations by respiration. As such, this project has two main purposes: extract BHI and direct respiratory modulation of the brain and build a brain connectivity tool that accounts for these confounding measures, built in the Python MNE environment to complement traditional data analysis pipelines. Our analysis functions will furthermore be validated through tutorial-like experiments, written as Jupyter notebooks on open datasets, and we hope that the results I show will convince the scientific audience of the importance of confounding peripheral measures in neural data.  \n\nThe minimal set of deliverables include: individual analysis functions for peripheral physiological signals, connectivity measures between peripheral and neural signals, and brain connectivity measures, both regular, and conditioned on peripheral physiological signals to remove their effect, and experiments demonstrating these tools on open datasets.",

Additionally, OSC-based communication between Python and PureData was implemented to enable real-time audio processing. Building on this foundation, this project will introduce AI-driven gesture recognition using lightweight, GPU-accelerated models to improve accuracy and responsiveness. The gesture-music mapping will be expanded to support both trigger-based events (e.g., drum beats) and continuous controls (e.g., pitch, reverb, and panning), allowing for more expressive musical interactions. The project will also integrate GestureCap with MaxMSP and Ableton Live, making it more accessible to musicians and producers. Further improvements will focus on latency reduction, real-time inference optimizations, and testing OpenPose-based feature extraction as a potential enhancement. If time permits, a visualizer for live gesture-music interaction will also be developed.

This project aims to leverage the existing DevoGraph framework to model the intricate developmental processes of C. elegans, specifically focusing on embryogenesis and the formation of its connectome, using advanced temporal graph techniques. The core methodology will involve employing Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph (DTDG) models, with an initial emphasis on the EvolveGCN architecture. The project will begin by constructing temporal graph representations from available C. elegans developmental datasets, including cell lineage and connectome data. Subsequently, EvolveGCN, a model known for its ability to handle evolving graph structures, will be applied and potentially adapted to capture the dynamic nature of these developmental processes. The expected outcomes include a functional implementation within the DevoGraph repository, a model capable of explaining key aspects of C. elegans development, and valuable insights into the efficacy of temporal graph techniques for addressing this complex biological problem. Furthermore, the project will explore potential future directions such as the visualization of the developmental graphs and the investigation of continuous-time models to capture finer developmental dynamics.",

          "description": "This project aims to replace Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for inference problems involving complex or intractable likelihood functions, such as those in Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). While SBI uses deep networks to approximate posterior distributions, it can introduce hard-to-control biases and limit interpretability. In contrast, MCMC provides a more principled Bayesian approach by directly sampling from the posterior. A key challenge in using MCMC methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is their need for differentiable likelihoods, which are often unavailable in high-dimensional models like those for fMRI, EEG, or MEG data. This project addresses that issue by leveraging Automatic Differentiation (AD), which allows efficient gradient computation. Implemented in libraries like JAX, which enables fast, parallel computation on GPUs. The first goal is to translate existing Virtual Brain models - specifically the Montbrió model - into JAX. This model simulates brain dynamics and links simulated EEG BOLD dynamics to fMRI observations. Its parameters, currently estimated via SBI, will instead be inferred using MCMC for improved accuracy and scalability. Reparameterization strategies and hierarchical structures will be used to enhance MCMC performance and convergence. Deliverables include a JAX-based translation of the Montbrió model, implementation of MCMC-based inference, reparameterization strategies, benchmarking against SBI methods, and application to real neuroimaging data. The outcome will offer more robust tools for understanding neural dynamics and disorders, improving the accuracy and interpretability of brain models.",
