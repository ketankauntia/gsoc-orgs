This is particularly cumbersome when the Quality Assurance (QA) team needs to set up its testing environments, connect to the development environment, and then execute test plans. \n\nA well-established CI/CD pipeline would support quality assurance and integration efforts, thereby streamlining the process. The objective of this project is to construct a CI/CD pipeline that automates the test suite execution process and improve test coverage comprehensively. This includes automated tasks such as adding authentication, installing dependencies, and configuring integration test scenarios, which are currently performed manually. By enhancing CI/CD and automating testing procedures, it will significantly reduce the team's time investment in the validation phase of the development cycle for the cloud system. \n\nThis not only ensures the reliability and accuracy of D4CG platform’s data but also enables researchers to utilize this data to advance cancer research and increase opportunities for discovery.",

          "description": "The process of identifying patients meeting certain criteria is crucial to advance research and contributes to new knowledge in medicine and health. So, data on specific populations are necessary to perform such research. However, faced with vast and complex healthcare data, traditional data analysis and processing methods prove to be inadequate.For example, cohort discovery is a popular existing tool that can allow researchers to safely explore the data in the Research Data Warehouse (RDW) prior to making a data request. But in real-world scenarios, the cohort discovery tool is not easy to use because users need to get familiarized with the workflow of the tool and it may even acquire them to write complex query languages, such as SQL.\r\n\r\nWe also observe this inconvenience with the existing cohort discovery tool in\r\nD4CG, an open-source organization of the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons. As it works on building communities, platforms and becoming the critical data source for researchers and organizations, it has become evident that implementing an efficient cohort discovery tool would significantly enhance Research and Development (R&D) efficiency.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid growth power of Large Language Models (LLM), this project\r\nproposes an innovative solution to enhance the cohort discovery tool by developing a query agent based on LLM to achieve more flexible and efficient data analysis and processing. To prototype this query agent, this project focuses on refining natural language understanding (NLU), improving query accuracy, supporting more complex filters, and integrating feedback mechanisms to learn from user interactions. For example, Given a user question like “Can you help me find patients aged between 20 and 40 who have a history of toothache in the Clinic Table?”, the query agent takes the question along with the corresponding database schema as input. It then generates a query output that satisfies the user’s request.",
