          "description": "<p>Checker Framework provides a collection of type systems to prevent bugs on Java programs at development time. Although a type system might be useful to prevent certain types of errors, it requires the effort to write all the types, which might be an annoying task for developers. In order to tackle such problem, developers might use a type inference tool to write the types for a program. Particularly, to determine what type should be written for a procedure’s formal parameter, a type inference tool must examine the type of the argument at every call to that procedure. Thus, the type inference process requires a whole-program analysis. In conclusion, the main goal of this project is to create a single type inference tool that will work for any type system available in Checker Framework (e.g., Nullness and Interning Checker).</p>\n",

These NPEs come out at runtime as <code>RuntimeException</code> causing a  crash at runtime this leads to a large number of Issues being generated. This could be a result of not handling possible <code>null</code> values not being handled in many cases or outright poor design choices(as seen in many issues due to not handling <code>null</code> OR empty string as arguments while using certain flags).</p>\n<p><strong>Checker Framework's Nullness Checker</strong> runs as a compiler plug-in, and it issues a warning at every possible null pointer dereference. If it issues no warnings, the code is guaranteed not to throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> at run time.</p>\n<p>My project will ensure the significant reduction of these NullPointerException(s) before they happen (by checking them at compile time) rather than relying on users to report them and fixing them.</p>\n",

NullnessLight will trade full soundness for usability and speed, helping developers catch common null-related bugs without requiring extensive annotations or setup. Inspired by tools like NullAway, NullnessLight will disable some of the more complex features of the existing Nullness Checker, such as initialization analysis and alias invalidation, and provide user-configurable options for these trade-offs. This project will broaden the Checker Framework's usability spectrum and help users gradually adopt deeper verification. Deliverables include the implementation of NullnessLight, a suite of comparisons with existing checkers (e.g., NullAway, FindBugs), and documentation with usage recommendations.",

Unlike the current Index Checker, which focuses on fixed-length structures like arrays and strings, this checker will track collection size changes across mutations, enabling flow-sensitive reasoning and validation of index accesses.\n\nThe checker will support annotations like @IndexFor, @LengthOf, @SameLen, and custom subtyping rules to enforce both lower and upper bounds on index values. It will also provide support for aliasing-aware length consistency, post-mutation invalidation, and integration with purity annotations.\n\nDeliverables include:\n    - A new pluggable type checker integrated into the Checker Framework.\n    - Support for standard mutable collections with annotated APIs.\n    - Type qualifiers and subtyping rules for index tracking.\n    - Flow-sensitive analysis and invalidation logic on mutations.\n    - Real-world examples, documentation, and a case study on annotating existing codebases.\n\nThis tool will help developers prevent IndexOutOfBoundsException in mutable structures by enforcing correctness at compile-time—making Java applications safer and more robust.",
