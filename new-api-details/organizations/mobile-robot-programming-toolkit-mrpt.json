At present, there are no Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter ROS packages with such broad range of features. The existing <em>slam_gmapping</em> ROS package, which is based on gmapping from OpenSLAM, uses only grid-based maps from laser data. The implementation from the MRPT library can work simultaneously with multiple instances of grid-based maps, point maps, beacon maps and combinations of them. Moreover, MRPT provides several types of Particle Filters such as PF with Standard and Optimal [Grisetti et al., 2007] Proposals, as well as an Approximate Optimal Sampling [Blanco et al., 2008a]. Thus, existing <em>slam_gmapping</em> package features only a subset of this functionality and robotics community will benefit greatly from being able to use implementation offered by MRPT library. Therefore, the goal of this project is to provide MRPT-powered ROS packages for Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter.</p>\n",

The suggested strategy builds upon the ideas developed by (Olson, 2009) for the data association and robust loop closing parts, while using already implemented schemes (mrpt version of Levenberg Marquardt, iSAM solver) for dealing with the optimization part. The result by the end of summer should be a fully functional, robust and usuable graph-based SLAM algorithm ready to be used by researchers and roboticists. We provide an overal timeline, with intermediate milestones to make sure that we meet the goals of the project. The proposal begins with an introduction to the graph-based formulation and lists already implemented and successful graphSLAM strategies. The following two sections (implementation details, timeline) describe the graphSLAM algorithm that we suggest. The final section provides with general information about the author and his background in simultaneous localization and mapping and open-source programming projects</p>\n",

A variety of techniques have been developed to\nestimate the pose using a monocular camera. However, the algorithms developed do not meet the\nsimultaneous requirement of computation time, precision and efficiency. The proposed algorithm,\nLinear Least Squares (LLS-PnP) would minimize the  cost function (non-linear error norm)\nwhich can be explicitly expressed as a quadratic function of the rotation matrix. The position is eliminated using least squares formulation. This leads to the possibility to solve the estimation problem in a closed form w.r.t. the rotation matrix. The proposed algorithm will break new grounds in computer vision and can be extended for pose estimation using Stereo vision. The final product (toolkit) will comprise of the new algorithm and the state-of-the-art PnP algorithms, which will provide the end user the choice to choose any given algorithm as well as to enable performance comparison between the various algorithms.</p>\n",

Each of the features/key-points are associated with some sort of key signatures (called descriptors of those key points). Many existing methods for detection/description of these features exists, each descriptor has certain properties that are suitable for certain vision applications. Some of the existing methods include SIFT, SURF, BRISK, FAST, ORB,AKAZE, LATCH, LSD/BLD (lines), etc. Some of the detectors already provide descriptors but some of them do not, so different combinations of descriptors can be used.
