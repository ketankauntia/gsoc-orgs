Biologists often need to study the different versions of a gene called transcripts. Transcripts are important because an increase in the abundance of one of the versions may lead or drive cancer. This project aims at building a new application where the rows will be transcripts and columns will be data types about that transcript. Both the applications will then be linked giving users a smooth toggle between the sample centric and transcript centric views about the same underlying data. The project also proposes to blend the visual spreadsheet view and the chart view in a way that a column will plot the transcript expressions across a set of samples.</p>\n",

For this (genomics visualization and analysis), there are many datasets which are provided by data hubs available with Xenabrowser itself which users can use.

Our discussion of interest lies in GDC Hub.</p>\n<p>GDC (Genomic Data Commons) Hub fetches data from the GDC repository: <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository\" target=\"_blank\">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository</a> via the GDC API. However, the data on the Xena is not updated. Current Xena data was updated on release 10, roughly 1.5 yrs ago. This project mainly revolves around updating data on xena with the current release (release 15). This will also simplify the process of adding data to Xena removing the XML files as a source.</p>\n",
