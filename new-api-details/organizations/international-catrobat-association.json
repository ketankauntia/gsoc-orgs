The Scratch to Catrobat converter is a tool that converts programs written in MIT's popular visual desktop programming language Scratch into Catrobat programs. In contrast to Scratch, Catrobat is a visual programming language tailor-made for mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets.</p>\n<p>This project is intended to improve the user experience of the conversion process. The main points of these improvements refer to replacing the web interface with a native UI (directly integrated into Pocket Code's Android app) and implementing a WebSocket client that communicates with a central web service. In addition to that, users can search for Scratch programs inside the app and select programs they would like to convert. Those Scratch programs are then converted by the server into Pocket Code programs that can be executed on their mobile device. On the server-side, the web service should act as a central hub for any kind of client applications being planned in the future. Thus, server-related preparations and improvements have to be made as well.</p>\n",

In order to do this, I will test a multitude of possibilities and check the results, until I find the most suitable one in order to make the projects behave in the same way both on Android and iOS. I will use iOS native sensors, understand how they work and get the most of their functionality in order to improve the existing code.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I would create a framework for the sensors used in iPhones and add some general functions to help me throughout the development of the project, but also to help other developers work with sensors better. This will allow me to modularise the code and improve its readability. In the end, I would refactor the code to make it as readable and organised as possible, so it can become easy to be maintained by other contributors in the future.  Also, for every progress I make throughout the project, I will create some mock examples to test its functionality and discover new ways to improve it, such as edge cases.</p>\n",

Lots of business logic is currently untested, or tested via UI since so many of those nearly unmockable God Objects are used there. To remedy this, those classes should be broken up into smaller classes with a clearly defined responsibilities, as well as their usages reevaluated and refactored as well. Existing unit tests are to be refactored and new tests of formerly hard to test parts are to be written.\nA good example is the Formula object in catrobat, since it is pure business logic, but currently calls a number of singletons and needs a context which can be refactored quite easily and have unit tests put in place.</p>\n",

The game is inspired by a hugely popular 2D game “Hollow Knight”.\nThe main character of the game is Batro who is the king of the Batona kingdom. At each level, king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level, the king fights with Giant Monster Martian and frees his Kingdom from the evil Monsters.\nThe player follows Batro in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games if used efficiently and effectively.</p>\n",

Merging options for UI \n3.1 Abort Merge \n3.2 Automatic Merge Without Conflict Search ( may not import everything) \n3.3 Manual Merge ( Powerful Merge every conflict needs to be resolved) \n\n4. Device specific configurations \n4.1 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive variables \n4.2 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive bricks \n\n5.
