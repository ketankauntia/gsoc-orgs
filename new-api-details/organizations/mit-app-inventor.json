The Proposal focuses on the improvement of Listview so that after the final enhancements, the user can add Images and Text in the order they wish. \nRuntime Instantiation of Components enables the user to instantiate components by just using the blocks. This in turn gives the user, the ability to add components at runtime and instantiate them when necessary. This feature can boost the memory management in App inventor by assigning memory when needed. \nThe proposal also marks the enhancement of file access. The app inventor currently doesn't support the access of External Storage in general. The proposal focuses on adding this feature so that many apps such as file managers can be made. Now, app inventor need not call an intent to access a file.\nFinally the proposal focuses on adding animation properties to the components so that the user is able to give a \"Living\" feel to their application.</p>\n",

All components in app inventor are part of some screen or activity which means that if the screen is not visible or the screen is destroyed by the Android system, the components stop running. An example of this is the Pedometer component which stops running when the phone screen is off. Ideally, a pedometer app would want to keep running once started in the background until the user of the app explicitly stops it. To enable such behavior it is necessary to run such components in a background process and re-start the process every time the system kills it.</p>\n",

To work around this, extension developers have to get a reference to a visible component as parent under which they create UI views. This, however, defeats the idea of App Inventor, which allows the users to create their UI of their apps using the concept of WYSIWYG.\nMy proposal to solve this problem is to have a generic <code>MockVisibleComponentExtension</code> which can be dragged into the designer. The extension will be just a visible component as opposed to non-visible component. This allows the extension to be placed under a <code>ComponentContainer</code> under which the extension can create its views. This allows the users to view a clear hierarchy of their app's UI when using \"visible\" extension. Then, there will also be a need for <code>MockComponentContainerExtension</code> into which any visible component/extension can be placed.</p>\n",

The origin of a sprite is the root of the sprite's coordinate system. All of the interactions of the sprite that may include collisions, positioning etc. is with respect to the origin. This project implements the desired functionality of custom origin in the appinventor system and adds an interactive way, via a drag-able marker, for selecting this origin easily.  </li>\n<li>Improving the algorithm used to detect collisions among sprites. Right now appinventor uses a naive algorithm to detect collisions between sprites. This collision detection does not work correctly for rotated image sprites and they are treated as if they were unrotated. This projects implements the SAT collision detection algorithm that replaces the naive implementation. This helps detect collisions in rotated image sprites and is more extensible.</li>\n</ol>\n",

This behaviour is pretty much the same as when you try to manage your files on your Operating System, and you can drag a rectangle to select multiple files, then moving them around, copying, deleting.\n\nThe design is that the Blocks multi-select feature will be only functional when you hold the Shift key, so that users can still drag the workspace when not. Users can simply click on the blocks to select or unselect them, or drag a rectangle to select a set of them at the same time. A button would also be added to enable multi-selection feature in case users are unable to access the keyboard.\n\nIt sounds like a little bit easy, but actually, I would say that it's not. Multiple selections can become a crazy-complex feature when you start thinking about the details. When dragging two blocks, you have to think about how the connections will work. When you right-click on multiple selections, you also have to make sure that those options apply to all blocks. And the touch screen problem would also need to be addressed.\n\nThe feature request (https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/issues/267) has remained open on the GitHub Issues for 6 years, but it's still in the discussion phase and far from the beginning of Implementation there. So I hope we can implement that during GSoC 2022 if possible.",

          "description": "This proposal aims to implement the Menu, Sidebar, and Floating Action Button (FAB) components in iOS for MIT App Inventor, ensuring feature parity with Android as introduced in PR #2299. The Menu Component will introduce a dropdown-style menu supporting nested items, icons, and keyboard navigation. The Sidebar Component will provide a sliding navigation panel with swipe gestures, tap-to-close functionality, and essential navigation links like Home, Profile, Settings, and Logout. The Floating Action Button (FAB) will be a circular, floating button positioned at the bottom-right, supporting custom actions, animations, and a shadow effect for a modern UI experience. A key aspect of this project is ensuring feature parity with Android, maintaining UI/UX consistency across both platforms. \n\nI chose this project because it bridges the gap between iOS and Android, ensuring that MIT App Inventor provides a seamless cross-platform experience. It also enhances user experience by introducing smooth, intuitive navigation and interactions, making iOS-built apps more functional and engaging. Additionally, this project will expand MIT App Inventor’s capabilities by adding essential missing features, making the platform more versatile and user-friendly. \n\nThe estimated timeline for this project is 175 hours, covering implementation, testing, and final integration. Upon completion, this update will significantly enhance MIT App Inventor’s iOS version, making it a fully-featured, cross-platform development tool that aligns with modern app-building standards.",

The solution involves developing a responsive Designer panel, distinct from the AssetListBox, to upload, organize, and import assets. I’ll leverage the UserFileData structure for user-specific storage, integrate with Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and refactor existing UploadServlet logic for robust validation. Deliverables include a drag-and-drop UI, folder-based organization, batch import functionality, and UX enhancements like search and error handling. This 175-hour project, spanning June 2 to August 25, 2025, will enhance workflow efficiency for educators, students, and developers, aligning with App Inventor’s mission to simplify app creation.",

Teachable-LLM addresses this gap by integrating an on-device RAG pipeline, allowing users to build domain-specific chatbots without relying on external cloud services. A dedicated web app will serve as both a data management tool—enabling document import/export to a custom RAG database—and a playground for testing. Meanwhile, the ChatBot component will be extended to support RAG using the imported database. Key deliverables include the updated ChatBot component, a React-based web interface, thorough documentation, and pilot testing. This approach emphasizes accessibility, privacy, and simplicity, bringing advanced language model capabilities into the App Inventor ecosystem.",
