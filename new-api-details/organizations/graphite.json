Nodes are organized within a tree-like structure while adhering to specific constraints and design principles. This makes it possible to create a node positioning system that organizes the graph in collaboration with user actions. Through a set of deliverables including layout algorithms, cost quantification, heuristic-based reorganization, and a decision-making processes, this solution will enhance node graph clarity to users and adhere to design principles, all while still allowing flexibility in node positioning within the network.",

This lays the foundation to build further nodes and operations such as one sided stroke alignment, gradient across strokes. Further a new “mask mode” will be introduced, which works at tooling level to enable a way to implement marquee selection masking, which unlike traditional mask tools(clipping) also supports gradient based operations(masking) and supporting much more than simple lasso, free form or rectangle type selection present in other tools. Further, a system to show the types of nodes merged through the merge node will be implemented, along with their mask information.",
