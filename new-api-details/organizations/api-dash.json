By providing mobile compatibility, developers will seamlessly access API Dash features on their smartphones and tablets, enhancing productivity and workflow. The addition of environment variables, request history, and collection runners with monitoring significantly boosts API Dash's functionality, empowering developers with comprehensive testing capabilities and streamlined workflow management. Adapting the desktop version's features into a mobile interface optimized for limited screen space ensures that API Dash remains intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible on both Android and iOS platforms.",

          "description": "This project introduces an AI-powered agent that automates the transformation of API responses into structured UI schemas and functional UI components across various frontend frameworks. Using Multiple LLM-Based Agents, the system eliminates the need for manual UI creation by intelligently analysing API responses and generating corresponding UI structures. Additionally, it enables dynamic modification of UI components based on user prompts, allowing for customisation in design, layout, and behavior. By seamlessly integrating these capabilities into a unified workflow, the project streamlines frontend development, reducing manual effort and accelerating the UI generation process with a single-click solution.\nThe project also aims to create a simple one-click API Request to Tool Generation pipeline that can enable external AI agents to interact with APIs without any manual coding\n\nDeliverables:\n• A Modular AI Agent Creation & calling mechanism for apidash's future AI-based tasks\n\n• One-Click solution to generate UI components from an API Response\n\n• One-Click solution to automatically generate API Tools to be used in various Agentic Frameworks like Langchain, Autogen and so on.",

Debug requests based on Status codes & Error messages\n3. Generate API documentation\n4. Understand API and generate tests\n5. Generate plots & visualizations for API responses along with ability to customize\n6. Generate API integration frontend code for frontend frameworks like React, Flutter, etc.\n\nFor each of the tasks benchmark evaluations will also be done so that it is easier for end users to choose the right backend LLM.\n\nAdd support for various API Authentication Methods such as, Basic authentication, API Auth, API key, Bearer token, JWT Bearer, Digest Auth, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0.",
