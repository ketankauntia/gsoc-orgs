This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA.

There would be 3 basic types of metrics: counter, duration and gauge. Agent is to be build with modular architecture in mind with an option of changing implementation of both aggregator and parsers, which will allow to accurately describe differences between approaches to aggregation and text protocol parsing. Since the PMDA API is based on around callbacks the design has to be multithreaded.</p>\n<p>Agent is to be fully configurable with either PCP configuration options and/or separate configuration file. Writing integration tests is also in the scope of the project.</p>\n",
