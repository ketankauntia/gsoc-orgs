Annotation, change point detection, and outlier identification help you see how and when interesting changes occur in the time series generating function. I will make it easier to perform annotation and segmentation of time series data with sktime by improving the documentation of existing annotation tools within sktime and constructing my own estimators for time series annotation.",

Looking at these advances, the implementation of sktime’s deep learning module leaves a lot to be desired. As part of this project, the following will be the critical additions to the deep learning module:\nAdd simple Deep Learning models for Forecasting like LSTMs, GRUs, MLP, etc.\nInclude versatile and best performing models used in M5 for Forecasting (like N-Beats, use of LightGBM)\nResearch existing best performing forecasting and classification models and implement them if required (e.g., methods based on Transfer Learning)\nAdd soft functionality for ease of use (ensemble methods, send dataloader as input etc.)\nProvide improved documentation and tutorial notebooks for ease of understanding of users.\nAfter this project, users will be able to use deep learning models for forecasting and classification problems. They will be able to conveniently integrate sktime with their code, with an improved interface, varied inputs, better documentation, and tutorials for usage.",

Stray algorithm: an approach using extreme value theory for the anomalous threshold calculation, based on different time series features [1]. This objective will incorporate this algorithm into the annotation module.\n\n\n2. Intrinsic dimension: estimation of the intrinsic dimension of data is critical in unsupervised nonlinear timeseries, as it essentially represents the minimum number of parameters to describe the data. This objective aims to provide segmentation according to the intrinsic dimensionality over time [2] in the annotation module.\n\n\n3. Hidden Markov Model Anomaly Detection: methods for data with latent dependency structure. In this objective, we are interested in inferring the hidden state sequence, associated with an observed feature sequence [3].\n\n\n\n[1]https://robjhyndman.com/publications/stray/\n[2]https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72222-0\n[3]https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616874",
