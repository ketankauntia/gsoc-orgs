While decisions and actions are currently signed, citizens or even the government institutions, who do not own an immediate signed document (that is a short time after the document was uploaded), have no guarantee that this document was not altered some time after the upload. Thus, in order to limit the time span in which a document can be altered, Diavgeia is forced to store a log in Bitcoin Blockchain, at predefined time intervals.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Limit hard disk space needs of Diavgeia by having decisions stored as RDF. Thus, Diavgeia a rdf-ontology and an on demand RDF to PDF converter is provided.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Diavgeia links RDF decisions  to other greek ontologies (such as legislation) and promotes Open Linked Data.

Devanagari are designed with an axis mirrored in relation to the Latin. This is a significant start regarding the addition of Greek glyphs, since one has a glimpse of the designer’s original aesthetics and design intentions; it also provides a good basis for certain letterforms that could be transferred into the Greek design, rendering a balanced outcome for all the supported scripts.</p>\n",

A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.\nWith respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision.</p>\n",

This robot will have a compact design with little or no expandability in order for the students to engage more in the robot’s programming and understand various concepts. For that reason, we will have to ensure the robot’s resilience to avoid accidents and make it durable.\nApart from that, I plan on developing use-case scenarios in greek, ready to use by the teachers, including course objectives and possible extensions for each one.It would be nice to also develop extensive and simple guidelines of how to print and assemble the robot for everyone to follow, despite their technological background.\n\nSince we want the students to focus on programming and learning to develop their own algorithms, it is important to develop an easy-to-use, kids-friendly environment, preferably a desktop app, integrating Google’s Blockly. During the last GSoC, an API system was developed, so that using Blockly is expected to be easy. So, I would love to connect both the compact version and the full one with Scratch/Blockly following ELLAK ‘s aesthetics, like this existing prototype. The app should be colourful and have an interactive design, specially designed for students, also having multiple pop ups and information about their actions and whether they were successful or not. I would like to turn programming into a fun activity, so that the children can learn while having fun.\nHowever, since Blockly’s integration requires modifying the core library, I plan on rewriting some parts of the Raspberry Pi’s code  concerning movement control. There will be a custom functionality library for special control of every electronic part and sensor.",

However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones.\r\nHephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years.\r\nHephaestus detects bugs by:\r\n1.\tgenerating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract\r\n2.\tgenerating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference\r\n3.\tusing translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",

Right now, it lacks a solid login system, a scalable backend, and real-time updates from official university sources. Plus, there’s no easy way for other universities to customize or integrate the platform to fit their needs. This makes the app less flexible and limits its potential to be a truly unified solution for higher education in Greece.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nI’m proposing MyUni—a unified, open-source platform that fixes these headaches. Built with a modern MERN stack (Next.js, Express.js, MySQL), MyUni will offer a scalable backend, real-time data syncing via APIs, and a flexible CMS for announcements and updates. It’ll support multiple universities with customizable branding and layouts, all wrapped in a user-friendly interface. Using TypeScript, microservices, and tools like Nginx and Redis, I’ll ensure it’s fast, secure, and ready to grow.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n By the end of GSoC 2025, I’ll deliver:  \n\n* Web application that provide good user experience(UX) and has\ngood User Interface(UI).\n\n* Admin dashboard where myuni admin can able to handle CMS and more.\n\n* Student dashboard where student can able to take-care of their profile,\nnotifications of academics, and more.\n\n* Backend Architecture which serves as solution to all project requirements.\n\n* REST APIs with at least 95% test coverage.\n\n* REST APIs with modern design patterns.\n\n* Docker container image of entire app.",

Instead of scraping, we will systematically fetch records from Greece’s official Open Data Portal, extract metadata and text using OCR  and NLP tools , and organize everything in OpenSearch, which efficiently handles Greek text. A simple REST API will allow users to query companies, dates, and individuals while ensuring scalability, smart search, pagination, and overload protection. The project will provide an automated pipeline for downloading, processing, and indexing documents, along with clear documentation, Docker support, and easy cloud deployment. By unlocking these records, we’re not just solving a technical problem—we’re making public data truly public, empowering watchdogs, entrepreneurs, and citizens to better understand Greece’s business landscape.",

Currently, it includes a fixed tallying system for recording standard outputs, such as energy lost to ionization or defects. This project aims to extend OpenTRIM's capabilities by implementing a flexible, user-customizable tally system.\n\nThe new tally system will allow users to define, via JSON configuration, what simulation events to track (e.g., ion stopping, vacancy creation), how to bin data (e.g., in cylindrical or Cartesian coordinates), and what physical quantities to record (e.g., ion depth, deposited energy). It will be implemented as a new class hierarchy in C++, inheriting from the existing tally class, and will make use of the ArrayND data structure for multidimensional data storage.\n\nDeliverables include:\na) A customizable tally class with support for user-defined event handling\nb)JSON-configurable tally setup (geometry, energy bins, spatial bins, etc.)\nc) Sample tally implementations (e.g., ion range profiling)\nd) Unit tests, documentation, and tutorials for extending the system\n\nThis work will empower researchers and developers to tailor OpenTRIM output to their specific simulation needs, improving its usability and scientific value.",

          "description": "The Ziff–Gulari–Barshad (ZGB) model describes how CO and O₂ molecules adsorb and react on a metal surface represented as a square lattice. CO occupies a single site, while O₂ dissociates into two oxygen atoms placed on adjacent sites. When a CO and an O atom meet, they form CO₂, which leaves the surface and frees up space. As the CO partial pressure (yCO) changes, the surface transitions from oxygen-poisoned (no CO₂ production) to reactive (CO₂ formation) and eventually to CO-poisoned. Apothesis is a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator that models these surface reactions with high precision.\n\n\nThis project will build a Python-based “outer shell” around Apothesis to identify transition points using machine learning. We'll extract and label structured data (from SurfaceSpecies.dat and output.log) and generate surface images with Matplotlib or Pygame, classifying each state as “Poisoned” or “Not Poisoned.” A range of ML models—including traditional classifiers, CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, GNNs, and physics-guided models—will be trained and evaluated. The best-performing model will be integrated with Apothesis for real-time predictions. Additionally, we will develop PyApothesis, a user-friendly Python interface to change parameters, visualize simulations, and use the ML model—all through Python code.",
