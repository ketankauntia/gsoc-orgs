The Active scan will include tests to web application in SQL Injections vulnerabilities.To accomplish my idea I will test web application using Time Based techniques.\nAnother significant vulnerability is that the WebSocket protocol doesn’t handle authentication. Practically this means that, a WebSocket opened from a page behind authentication  doesn’t “automatically” receive any sort of authentication. That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client. Some other posible attacks and scans at WebSockets are the classic bruteforce attack, Local and Remote file inclusion, the Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. I am going to implement some of the above scans, (as more as possible) starting with SQls Injections. I strongly believe that we could easily add the scans if the basic infrastructure was build.

Then on the UI side, you have options to put text in blocks. A block will contain text, a time interval in the video and an image we\nwill show at that time interval. That’s how we can make multiple blocks after submitting the data. We will call the backend REST APIs in Django or flask, which will take those data blocks containing time intervals images and text.

          "description": "With the increase in use of technology and the internet, the risks associated with the internet are also increasing at a very high rate. Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin. I will also add additional features to the plugin.",

In brief, this is to be accomplished by creating a new directive `SecRateLimitOptions` for specifying the rate limit options(no. of requests allowed per minute, the algorithm used, when to clear rate limit, default action if rate limit exceeds) and a new non-disruptive action `rate limit` which enforces rate-limit on the matching chains of SecRule. A more detailed explanation can be found in the proposal PDF.\nThe set of deliverables, in the end, would be the plugin itself, support for distributed systems, and well-written documentation with examples, benchmarks, and recommended settings.",

They'll also be able to track their progress and see how they're improving. For beginners, the platform will highlight easy-to-start issues and group similar tasks together for hackathons.\nThe system will help solve common problems new contributors face by providing guidance, recommending tasks they can handle, and connecting them with experienced mentors who can help them grow.

Currently, its gap analysis functionality is resource-intensive, especially for large standards. This project proposes a performance overhaul of the gap analysis engine. The goal is to reduce memory usage, optimize Cypher queries in Neo4j, and experiment with a CRE-focused comparison approach to speed up the analysis. Deliverables include optimized Cypher/Redis logic, reduced redundant calculations, and an optional prototype for CRE-level gap detection, improving analysis time, scalability, and developer usability.",
