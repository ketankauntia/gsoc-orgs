In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack are re-implemented in Rust, a low-level language, and WebAssembly binary is generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools are used to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained.
