This improved the overall user experience and reduced editing latency.</p>\n<p>We aim to add multiprocessing support to VimL, the built-in scripting language of Neovim, by allowing functions to be invoked asynchronously in separate processes and enabling the retrieval of their results through callbacks and by waiting for them on demand in the parent process.\nThis multiprocessing feature will have a noticeable positive impact on the performance of parallelizable computations and tasks.</p>\n<p>This is achieved by introducing the following built-in multiprocessing primitives based on the job control feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>call_async({callee}, {args}[, {opts}])</code></li>\n<li><code>call_parallel({callee}, {arglists}[, {opts}])</code></li>\n<li><code>call_wait({ids}[, {timeout}])</code></li>\n<li><code>:&amp;:{cmd}</code> (invokes <code>{cmd}</code> asynchronously; has a custom predefined handler for <code>:[l]vimgrep[add]</code> commands)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Complementing the multiprocessing feature, is the context feature, which is a set of built-in functions to save and restore parts of the current editor state.</p>\n",

The goal of this project is to bring this functionality to Neovim.</p>\n<p>The aim of the project can be summarized as: Whenever the user starts Nvim as</p>\n<p><code>nvim --connect {addr}</code></p>\n<p>the Nvim will connect to the Nvim server running at <code>{addr}</code>, where <code>{addr}</code> is either a <code>pipe</code> or a <code>tcp</code> address.

So the Nvim client acts like any other external GUI.</p>\n<p>Thus, this project makes <code>TUI</code> an RPC client. This enables us to convert <code>nvim</code> from a multi-threaded process, where <code>TUI</code> and <code>nvim server</code> ran on separate threads, to a multi-process system with <code>TUI</code> and the <code>server</code> running as separate processes and interacting with each other using the RPC API (<code>MessagePack</code>) of <code>nvim</code>.</p>\n",

Enhanced LSP Support: Adding support for AI-related methods such as `textDocument/inlineCompletion` and improving LSP's handling of partial results with `PartialResultParam`.\n2. Progress Interface: Introducing a built-in progress interface (`vim.ui.progress`) to track and display long-running tasks, improving user experience during AI interactions.\n3. Prompt Buffer Improvements: Creating a new Lua API for multi-line and editable prompt buffers to facilitate interactive AI chats or REPL-like environments.\n\nBy addressing these areas, this project will provide a foundation for integrating AI into Neovim while offering general usability and extensibility improvements for all users.",
