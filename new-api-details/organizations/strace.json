In the second case, we do not care about these\nproblems, just open one more terminal emulator and type the following command:<br>\n<code>$ asinfo [OPTIONS] write (just one example)</code><br>\nTo sum up, the output is purposed for people and providing all information about syscall(syscall\nnumber, meaning of flags, etc) can significantly reduce the debug time.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>When strace is tracing a process which is in an other process namespace than strace itself, PIDs in system call arguments and return values are printed as PIDs in the target process' namespace. This is normal behavior, as these are the actual values that are passed between the process and the kernel. But it would be useful to have an option for strace to translate these ids to strace's own pid namespace. For example when tracing a process inside a Docker container, the translated PIDs allows us, to access these the processes from the host environment (eg. inspecting processes created by the clone syscall).\nThe goal of the project is to add a flag to strace, which enables this translation.</p>\n",
