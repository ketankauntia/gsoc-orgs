Currently, it collects only the minimal information, including the <em>hazelcast version, java version, operating system, uptime, memory used, number of clients, number of clusters, etc.</em></p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to give a fine-grained view to this by collecting detailed usage information about the Hazelcast features being used actively by the community. For this, we need to collect various metrics of several data structures provided by the hazelcast and of the cloud configuration used for the deployment of hazelcast. The Phone Home of the hazelcast gathers this data daily, which will continually help to enhance the hazelcast product.</p>\n",
