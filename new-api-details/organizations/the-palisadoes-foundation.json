As the app is being targeted to a broad audience so we need to support more language for great user experience and engagement. While the current language will be reused, we will be changing its hardcoded nature in the widgets (like app bar, buttons, form fields etc) to a more dynamic one. Users will be allowed to easily switch the language of their choice during Signup or Login. Users will also have the capability to change the language inside the app. Talawa app aims to build a strong and meaningful relationship among the members of the organizations with the help of features like group chats, news feed and events. Therefore making sure of effective communication between people of different language is also necessary. Modification in the backend will be done accordingly to help different language users to communicate effectively in groups. This project idea serves to solve the barrier of communication which can hinder the growth of the community through the Talawa app.</p>\n",

I will also implement a way so that users can select or use talawa-admin in their preferred language and I will be implementing a feature for detecting whether a user is spamming a chat or not. Below are the features for talawa-admin that I am going to add this summer that will boost its usability, user experience, and its use cases.\n\nTalawa-admin Features: \n\nInteractive UI/UX.\nMultiple screens (Mobile or Tablet) are responsive.\nFunctional screens (components).\nImplementing the support for different languages.\nFeature to detect whether the user is spamming the chat or not.\nMigration from redux-routing to react-routing. *",

Currently, the documentation website is being powered by numerous Markdown files which are being rendered into a static website with the help of Docusaurus. \n\nThe challenge is to find and implement a way to generate documentation (in the form of static HTML files) from comments within the files, which can then be hosted on the site used for documentation. This will enable the documentation to grow organically with the codebase. We target to automate the creation of our documentation using the content of our code repositories on our existing documentation website. \n\nThis will give Palisadoes the flexibility to maintain its Markdown documentation and its website more efficiently.",

The lack of visualization tools makes it difficult to interpret network data effectively. Additionally, there is currently no system in place to store historical bandwidth and location-related data in the database. As a result, generating historical bandwidth charts and device movement visualizations for long-term analysis is not possible.\nThis project focuses on modernizing the SwitchMap-NG web UI/UX to improve usability and expand adoption by the wider community. Key improvements include:\n1. Integrating a React-based frontend with the existing Flask backend to modernize the UI.\n2. Replacing deprecated packages with a modern alternative, such as React Table.\n3. Implementing network topology charts using CDP/LLDP data with react-graph-vis.\n4. Adding historical device movement visualization with React-Leaflet & OpenStreetMap.\n5. Introducing bandwidth charting for better insights using tools like Recharts.\n6. Containerizing the new UI for seamless deployment.\n7. Automating documentation generation and ensuring 100% test coverage.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Modern React-Based UI replacing legacy table views\n2. Interactive Network Topology Visualization using CDP/LLDP data\n3. Historical Bandwidth and Movement Charts with time-based insights\n4. Containerized UI with install/config scripts for easy deployment\n5. Autogenerated Documentation and GitHub Actions integration\n6. 100% Test Coverage and fully enforced CI/CD pipelines",
