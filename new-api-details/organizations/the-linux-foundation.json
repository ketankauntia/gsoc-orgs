I propose to develop a set of specifications for an environment model generator of the LDV Tools system developed in terms of the Linux Driver Verification program.

The dynamic form content includes digitally filled forms, tax forms or any kind of registration forms. When the user tries to print the PDF with filled forms, the content either gets vanished or is not displayed properly. CUPS uses a filter named pdftopdf to handle printing of PDF forms. This filter performs some manipulations on PDF file before printing it. These manipulations results into content loss of filled forms. This project aims at adding PDF form flattening support to pdftopdf filter of CUPS wherein, the filter will identify whether the PDF files contains dynamic content or not and if yes, then it will first convert the PDF into static content and then perform its manipulations. It includes adding the actual functionality in QPDF, a library that is internally used by pdftopdf filter for PDF file processing. And then using this functionality of QPDF library to perform the flattening work by the pdftopdf filter.</p>\n",

PaStA helps to analyse them and groups patches based on their similarity. A number of open source projects ( eg. the Linux kernel ) leverage mailing lists to support their development. All communication happens on these lists and contributors send patches to the lists for the maintainers to review. Given a mailbox of such a project PaStA can also map upstream commit references to corresponding patches in the mailbox. One of the major goals for PaStA has been to integrate with Patchwork. Patchwork is a web based patch tracking system. It helps both contributors track the state of their patches and maintainers efficiently review patches. As a first step PaStA can be used to automate the process of adding related patches to a patch on Patchwork. The primary goal of this project is to complete PaStA’s integration with Patchwork.</p>\n",

Also, local print queues are managed using local printer tools, while administration interfaces run on browsers.

This tool was initially released for Linux developers who send patches on mailing lists, but it can also be applied to other projects. To describe matching and transformation rules in the source code with a patch-like appearance, Coccinelle employs a domain specific language called the Semantic Patch Language (SmPL), and attempts to manipulate the given C code based on the given SmPL rule.  Although SmPL can provide many useful matching and transformation features, there are limits to the C matching patterns that the SmPL grammar can express due to the complexity of the C grammar. This is particularly the case for function headers, that involve complex types, annotations, etc that have been somewhat less tested by the users of Coccinelle. This project will study the current status and limitations of the handleability of function headers by designing and running a script that checks whether each function header in a given project can be parsed correctly and applying it to the latest Linux kernel. Based on the results, any detected problems will be fixed.</p>\n",

The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on.\n\nAs of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles.\n\nThe Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia.\n\n\nThis project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",

It provides the support to analyze the stacks end to end leading from hardware events such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches mispredicted to software events such as CPU-clock, page-faults, task-CPU etc. The linux perf tools help us to point out exactly where the specific event is leading to performance downturn in kernel, BPF or userspace application. The increasing demand for consolidation due to the bloom in fields of AI and the cloud technology requires increased efforts to provide best performance for novel devices. As software systems become increasingly complex, identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks becomes more challenging. In an effort to address this issue, this project seeks to enhance the support for performance data analysis in various formats commonly used by software developers. Specifically, we aim to enable the export of performance data to formats such as Firefox's Gecko profile format and Chrome's trace event format, making it easier for developers to analyze and optimize their code for different platforms and environments. By doing so, we hope to improve the overall performance and user experience of software applications.",

This is called Continuous Integration (CI).\nWhat is triggered on each commit is usually some static analysis of the code using common, specialized tools and build and execution tests, usually doing `./configure; make; make test` on different system platforms.\nThis naturally requires test scripts/programs compiled and run by the `make test` step. For CUPS, for example, the daemon is started (on an unprivileged port so that it does not need root), queues created and listed, jobs sent, and the logs checked whether everything went OK. For Ghostscript, a large collection of input files (gathered from bug reports) is processed and converted into raster formats.\nThe task here is to write test programs for the different OpenPrinting projects so that `make test` does something useful, efficiently catching regressions. They should exercise important functionality of the software with different parameters and analyze logs and output files to check whether the program did the expected work.\nTest programs are also needed for the so-called 'autopkgtest' tests which are added to Debian packages and executed whenever the package is uploaded to Debian or Ubuntu.\nIn addition, instruction files and shell scripts are needed to build the software on different platforms/environments, run tests, and create GitHub Actions (for the automatic triggering on each commit)",

It does not only cover many printers to give them support under Linux and free software operating systems at all, but also is optimized for highest possible print quality, so that at least on some printers and with the right settings you can even get better print quality than with the original (Windows/Mac) drivers. Right Now We only have retrofitting application that supports gutenprint so we need Native Gutenprinter application.\n\nSolution to the Problem - Here We create a native printer applcation by using pappl and libgutenprint library. Here on an incoming get-printer-attributes IPP request we call the same functions which the PPD generator calls, but instead of translating the responses into a PPD file we translate it into the IPP answer for the get-printer-attributes request. And when we have a job to print, we call the library functions which the filter calls, but directly. \n\nMy task to implement above is - \n - Create a PAPPL-based Printer Application using the libgutenprint library and PAPPL\n - Make sure all options and parameters of the Gutenprint driver are accessible from the Printer Application's web admin interface.\n - Package the Printer Application as a Snap\n\nDeliverables - My goal is to deliver a native printer application  from Gutenprint.
