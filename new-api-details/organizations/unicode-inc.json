Currently, Malayalam is not supported, despite being spoken by over 35 million people, primarily in Kerala, India.

The expected outcome is to enable correct grammatical inflections for Malayalam nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, improving tools such as chatbots, automated translation, and assistive technologies. The project will benefit Malayalam speakers worldwide by improving communication tools and making the language more accessible in computer applications.",
