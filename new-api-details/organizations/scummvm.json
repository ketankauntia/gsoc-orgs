Since this is very slow, the main idea of this project is to statically link detection features into the executable so</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Games are detected without loading of a plugin</li>\n<li>Game detection is faster</li>\n<li>Other parts remain as-is, so our low-end platforms will gain performance boosts</li>\n</ul>\n",

The Lingo Dictionary will be helpful for figuring out the functionality offered by each STUBed function.\n\nThe main focus of this project is to restructure the Director engine's internal data structure of storing Director movie files (.dir and .dcr) which enables saving them in Director. The project by djsrv available on GitHub is a great reference for solving this problem.\n\nThe proposal also hopes to improve the support for a couple of director games namely, The Journeyman Project and Safecracker. Comparing these games to their original versions, this project hopes to make playable without any hiccups.",
