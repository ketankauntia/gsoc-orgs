The only solution is converting a raster image to vector graphics or completely redraw it. After adding the vectorization feature to Synfig, scanned drawings and raster images can be easily converted into Vector Images which are resolution independent. Moreover, the obtained vector graphic can be further edited in Synfig.

This project aims to replace the script with a robust, automated solution to streamline bundle generation, ensure macOS security compliance, and enhance the native user experience. By leveraging Python for dependency collection, C++ for environment setup, and CMake/CPack for packaging, the project will deliver a signed, distributable SynfigStudio.app bundle. Key improvements include faster dependency gathering, proper code signing, embedded environment setup, Python/lxml integration, and macOS-native interface enhancements.\n\nApproach:\n\t•\tDevelop a Python script to efficiently collect and stage dependencies, optimizing with caching and parallelization.\n\t•\tImplement code signing in reverse dependency order using codesign, including Python and lxml binaries.\n\t•\tRemove the external launcher script by embedding environment setup in the C++ entry point.\n\t•\tPackage Python and lxml into the bundle, ensuring compatibility and signing.\n\t•\tIntegrate CPack into CMake to generate a polished .dmg installer.\n\t•\tEnhance the UI with macOS-native menu bar and window behaviours using GTK.\n\nDeliverables:\n\t•\tA CMake/CPack-based build system producing a signed SynfigStudio.app bundle.\n\t•\tA Python script for automated dependency collection and path rewriting.\n\t•\tCode signing support for all binaries, including Python and lxml.\n\t•\tEmbedded environment setup within SynfigStudio, eliminating the launcher script.\n\t•\tA bundled Python runtime with lxml, fully signed and functional.\n\t•\tA distributable .dmg installer generated via CPack.\n\t•\tmacOS-native UI improvements (e.g., menu bar, shortcuts, dialogs boxes).\n\t•\tComprehensive documentation covering installation, usage, and build instructions.",
