However, it does not have powerful student management functionalities right now, which means a teacher can not reassign students to another team, change the team name or set an identifier for students, etc.</p>\n<p>To make the GitHub classroom more wonderful, I propose to implement various features for student management and build a student management interface for the classroom project, on which the teacher can have an overview of students involved in the classroom, management group assignment teams, and add identifiers for students, etc. By implementing those features, we can make GitHub classroom more easy to use and give the teacher more control on their classrooms.</p>\n",
