There is a recent trend to integrate aspects of both disciplines, commonly by \"adding types\" to languages originally designed as dynamic.</p>\n<p>There has been interest in the Ruby community to explore such an approach: Yukihiro Matsumoto devoted his keynote at RubyConf 2014 to the potential implementation of static typing in the language. The topic is complex: a Ruby tightly corseted by types would not be true to the essence of the language.</p>\n<p>Under a gradual typing discipline, type annotations can be specified at will: interesting parts of the program can be given explicit types and their type safety checked statically. We propose an implementation of gradual typing in Matz's Ruby Interpreter, drawing inspiration from similar additions to other dynamic languages, with strictly optional type annotations consistent with Ruby's DRY and \"lazy\" philosophy and an evaluation of the practical usefulness of gradual typing.</p>\n",

Consequently, users do not have to manually manage memory, and can more easily avoid memory management issues such as memory leak. However, the program being executed must be stopped for the GC to run. Therefore the efficiency of the GC algorithm will affect the performance of the program.\n\nThe project’s goal is to reduce the cost of GC when there are multiple fibers. Fibers are a memory efficient way to implement cooperative concurrency. Programmers control scheduling of the fiber instead of the operating system, making it possible to better allocate CPU resources. Ruby 3.0, released in 2020, added a Fiber Scheduler, which enables asynchronous behaviour in programs. Ruby’s GC scans through a program’s memory at various points during its execution, identifies which objects are no longer used, and removes them using an incremental tri-color mark and sweep algorithm and generational garbage collection. Improving the GC cost when there are many fibers will enhance the performance of Ruby programs, particularly asynchronous Ruby programs making use of fibers.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Reproducible test that triggers GC for fibers\n2. Identification of GC bottlenecks for fibers\n3. Reduction of bottlenecks compared to benchmark test through improvements to GC\n4.
