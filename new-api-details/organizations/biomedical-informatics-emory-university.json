This makes the program not portable, slow, and dependent on the up-time of the server it is hosted on. Therefore the goal of this project is to design and release a portable, stand-alone program coded in JavaScript able to mirror what POSDA does and interpret and display DICOM IOD tables on any device with a browser as well as add new features such as new rendering parameters and make UI more usable and responsive.</p>\n",

For example, it could be interesting to calculate the abundance (by area) of regions like angiogenesis, necrosis, and infiltrating lymphocytes to infer patient-level characteristics.\n    A tissue slide can easily reach around 20GB in-memory, which turns intractable many approaches of feeding those slides entirely to a classifier. One recent method for addressing this problem is sampling regions based on low-resolution features (i.e. texture, boundaries) for extracting information about the tissue. Moreover, this method can also help with speeding up the processing, since after cropping the proposed regions, the problem would be turned into a tractable learning problem.</p>\n",
