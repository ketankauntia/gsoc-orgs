Videos that are out of sync are often uncomfortable to watch to a viewer, so it is mandatory that any reasonable video editing software should contain some audio/video sync mechanisms, otherwise the software may not be used because the users would quickly become discouraged. Currently VLMC lacks any reasonable strategy for synching streams from multiple video sources. This often leads to final video being out of sync if its composed of material from multiple sources. The goal of this proposal is to introduce a solution to this problem - an abstract clock mechanism, that would feed renderers with data at just the right time.</p>\n",

However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with.\n\nVLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests:\n\n1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar)\n\n2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar\n\n3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app\n\nLastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window. A set of playback controls such as QuickTime’s, which are inconspicuous and relocatable, would be a great addition to VLC and would make the transition for QuickTime users seamless. There would still be opportunities here for VLC’s branding to come through, mainly with the use of accent colours.",

This endeavour involves the development of a Wasm Plugin Manager within VLC, allowing for the utilisation of plugins written in various languages that support Wasm compilation. By introducing this feature, VLC users will have the flexibility to create plugins in their preferred programming languages, streamlining the plugin development process and expanding VLC's capabilities. While the Lua scripting system will remain in place for now, this project lays the groundwork for a potential transition to Wasm-based plugins in the future, offering users even more options for customization and extension of VLC's functionality.",

The current AppKit-based UI lacks macOS Sequoia's visual polish, struggles with libvlc’s newer playback features (e.g., frame-accurate seeking), and suffers from inefficient media library management. This outdated design hinders usability and fails to make use of macOS’s native capabilities.\n\nSolution:\nRedesign VLC’s macOS interface using AppKit to implement a pre-approved, user-tested design that integrates into macOS visual aesthetics and libvlc’s advanced APIs. The overhaul will:\n1. Replace legacy Carbon-era UI components with modern NSCollectionView and NSSplitViewController layouts.\n2. Integrate libvlc’s latest playback controls (frame stepping, HDR metadata) into native transport UIs.\n3. Rebuild the media library using Core Data for performance and NSDiffableDataSource for real-time updates.\n4. Prioritize system consistency with SF Symbols, vibrant materials, and macOS accessibility standards.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Modern UI Components:\n- Unified toolbar with adaptive controls (NSToolbarItemGroup)\n- Redesigned media library with thumbnail grid (NSCollectionView) and smart filters (NSPredicateEditor)\n2. Enhanced Playback:\n- Frame-accurate seekbar with NSSlider tick marks synced to libvlc’s next_frame() API\n- HDR tone mapping toggle using CAMetalLayer integration\n3. Optimized Media Management:\n- Rules-based playlists backed by Core Data\n- Spotlight-like search using NSFetchRequest\n4. Developer Documentation:\n- Migration guide for plugin developers\n- NSAccessibility implementation notes\n\nBy collaborating closely with VLC’s core team and iterating on the existing codebase, this project will deliver a performant, native macOS experience that bridges the gap between VLC’s powerful engine and modern user expectations.",

Using libdvdcpxm and related tools, the module will extract, decrypt, and decode high-fidelity DVD-Audio, ensuring seamless integration with VLC's existing playback architecture. The final deliverables include a working VLC module, full documentation, and optimizations for performance and compatibility.",

It will implement intuitive dynamic-length seeking based on swipe distance, allow users to set a custom default playback speed, and fix critical subtitle bugs affecting size consistency, character rendering (e.g., Chinese), and display/selection accuracy. Furthermore, the project will introduce a dual subtitle display feature, particularly useful for language learners. The deliverables will be these functional improvements integrated into the VLC iOS app, including the dynamic seek, custom speed setting, resolved subtitle problems, and the new dual subtitle capability, accompanied by necessary testing and documentation.",
