The goal is to develop an open-source framework that integrates FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards with federated learning, allowing secure and collaborative research without centralized data sharing. The solution will include: 1) A production-ready FHIR server deployable on a cloud platform with built-in HIPAA/GDPR compliance. 2) Smart middleware for smooth data transformation between healthcare systems and AI models. 3) Privacy-preserving federated learning workflows that allow institutions to train models jointly while maintaining decentralized data. 4) Comprehensive resources, such as synthetic test datasets, performance benchmarks and detailed deployment guides. By making advanced healthcare AI accessible and privacy-conscious, this project empowers researchers to drive personalized medicine discoveries while safeguarding data security. The open-source approach fosters transparency and encourages broad adoption, helping break down data silos across global healthcare systems.",

The complete solution will serve as a reference implementation for academic GPU cluster management, providing reusable components and best practices for similar infrastructure requirements in the ML research community.",
