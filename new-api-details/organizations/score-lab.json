As the amount of data becomes extreme large, normal computing methods cannot handle such a volume. Running Big Data on Spark ecosystems might be a reasonable way. Its capability to compute data at large scale give us a good solution. However, most of data are unlabeled data; and labeling data not only means highly cost but also requires expertise in that domain.  That is to say, using Supervised Learning algorithms might be unreasonable. In addition, Semi-supervised learning might not be a good way too as for its assumptions need some particular data distributions. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering-based) is a good start step towards this problem. \n       Thus, in this project, I am trying to solve this problem by two phases: retrieving data from Elasticsearch-Hadoop; building a statistical analysis tool on Spark streaming computing from a clustering perspective.

With growing DevOps tools, it is now a tedious and time-consuming task SREs and developers to continuously monitor their remote applications running inside a multicluster Kubernetes environment. Though there are some great tools using which we can monitor Kubernetes tools there is a need for easy deployment setup and an alerting tool that people can use to get alerts when something goes wrong inside their application running in a Kubernetes environment. It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction. This brings us to address the problem of out of box metrics, traces, events and logs collection for applications running inside Kubernetes, reporting all the collected data on a single dashboard and push notifications to users for critical ones. The collected metrics, traces, events and logs will help to debug the application running inside Kubernetes faster and effectively.",

With the help of zero-shot, few-shot, and fine tuning techniques we could effectively specialize a language model for the use case. Summarization is one such use case that has been widely researched for a couple of years now. Broadly there are techniques such as Abstractive and Extractive approaches. The motive of this project proposal is to handle the summarization task (mostly Abstractive + Extractive hybrid approach) through the language model’s (foundation model) lens. This project aims to cover everything from data collection, EDA, experimenting with different language models to developing production-scale system that can take GitHub repo as reference and provide summary. One of the challenges that is novel is to use smaller sized models to achieve great performance in summarization.\n\nSCoRe Lab has been into developing solutions in the space of making user life easier with products such as D4D, Bassa, Track Pal, and others. This project will add to that portfolio and would be a great reference for AI practitioners and system developers which aims to work right from data to production-grade end product using AI and Systems.",

Users can effortlessly retrieve news articles either through specific keywords or without, streamlining the information acquisition process.\n\nOnce a user requests our API, it retrieves news data from our knowledge base and feeds it to ChatGPT. After ChatGPT processes the data, the API obtains the response and returns it in JSON format.",
