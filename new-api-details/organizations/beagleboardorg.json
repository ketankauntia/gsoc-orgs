Creating an easy to implement realization of SPI slave would definitely help the BeagleBone community members to write applications based on SPI much more easily. The first implementation of my protocol driver is going to example of a bidirectional data exchange. This application will provide the BeagleBone community with valuable experience and will be a good example of SPI slave.\nHardware limitations make it impossible to perform any realization of the device using SPI slave. Sending away data to the master during one transaction is not possible. One transaction is enough to receive data by slave device. To receive and send back data, two transactions are needed. The data received from master device in a single transaction is transferred to the user after completing the transaction. The user's reply to received data is sent in the next transaction.</p>\n",

Zephyr allows for easy handling of multiple configuration options, APIs and external components, and is well suited to structured application development. Another benefit of Zephyr is that it targets some very serious protocol and standard implementations, being e.g. the first open source RTOS to introduce TSN support – by way of Antmicro’s contribution. The rising popularity of TSN in automotive and aerospace applications, and just about everywhere else, could be a very important reason to start using Zephyr in your TSN-capable product.\nThe goal of the project is to add Zephyr RTOS support to run on Cortex R5 processor core loaded from A72 core running Linux through remoteproc and add few peripheral support (Interrupts, Gpio, UART, Timers) for TDA4VM. The Cortex R5 processor cores are built to provide deeply embedded real-time and safety-critical systems.

          "description": "This project aims to enable the development of models that are suitably efficient for use in real-time interactive applications on embedded systems such as the BeagleBone-based Bela. At the project's core is difflogic, a recent technique that employs sparsely-connected network composed of basic logic gates to obtain small models and fast inference. The core goal of the project is to enable a convenient workflow for developing difflogic models and running them on the Bela, with an expected workflow of developing and training models on a larger machine, followed by exporting the model to C and cross-compiling it for the BeagleBone - either the main CPU or the PRUs. To support this, I will develop wrappers for exporting compiled difflogic models for use in the languages supported on Bela (C++, Pure Data, SuperCollider, Csound).\n\nI will then build out integrations and applications of difflogic for the rapid development of useful audio models, exploring the possibilities for combining difflogic networks with DDSP (differentiable digital signal processing) and cheap/lightweight techniques and toolkits, \"porting\" well-known ML architectures to difflogic networks, and training difflogic networks to approximate the behavior of existing neural networks (knowledge distillation). I will develop example applications involving sound analysis, classification, and synthesis, and experiment with interactive machine learning.\n\nFinally, I will apply these techniques to a creative application inspired by work on bytebeat and sound matching: generating networks of logic gates to approximate sounds and exploring the space of such sound-generating networks. I will train difflogic gates to reproduce particular sounds, treating the entire network as a bytebeat-style audio-generating function of time.\nLastly, I will build an interactive application to explore the space of sound-generating networks (e.g. by mutating or morphing networks) and visualize the execution of logic gate networks.",

This project aims to upstream Greybus as an official Zephyr module, improving maintainability, accessibility, and seamless integration within the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem.\n\nBy upstreaming Greybus, BeagleConnect and other Greybus-enabled platforms will gain native support in Zephyr, removing the need for custom patches or kernel modifications. Originally developed by Google as part of Project Ara, Greybus is a lightweight, high-speed protocol designed for efficient, low-power communication across diverse hardware interfaces. While initially intended for modular smartphones, Greybus has since expanded into IoT and industrial applications, particularly in wireless sensor networks.\n\nThis project will focus on cleaning up and refactoring the existing Greybus module, revamping its testing infrastructure, and ensuring compatibility with Zephyr’s CI/CD workflows. The successful completion of this work will enable seamless hardware-software interaction, making Greybus more accessible for embedded systems development within Zephyr.",
