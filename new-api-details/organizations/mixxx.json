There are now two\nmain controller types: <code>MIDI</code> and <code>HID</code>. This project is about developing the third one: <code>keyboard</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>keyboard</code> controller will be always visible in preferences -&gt; controllers. In contrast to the <code>HID</code>- and the <code>MIDI</code> controllers, which both have four tabs (Controller Setup, Input Mappings, Output Mappings and Scripts), the <code>keyboard</code> controller will just have two tabs: <em>Controller Setup</em> and <em>Key Mapping</em>. The <em>Controller Setup</em> will be the same as for the <code>HID</code> controllers, but the <em>Key mapping</em> tab will consist of a table with three columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Action</li>\n<li>Key (Or 'Key Combination')</li>\n<li>Comment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assigning key combinations will be as easy as clicking the <em>key (combination)</em> cell and pressing the desired key (combination). If the given combination is already chosen for another action, both actions will be disabled and highlighted red, indicating an error.</p>\n",

For some, beatmatching and syncing two tracks is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync function.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, more sophisticated automation can be helpful - maybe you want to skip a breakdown, shuffle around verses, loop an intro a specific way or deliberately repeat certain parts. Handling that while messing with effects and getting the next track ready can be tricky, so that is where Mixxx Macros will come in handy.

Before the effect was implemented, the pitch could be changed only using the deck's rate slider separately. Unfortunately, the mentioned Pitch Shifter has no wide range and imposes significant restrictions on ways other effects can interact with the sound. In this project, the new Pitch Shift effect is introduced in the built-in effects, which can be used in the effect chain. It implements the wish \"Add a Transpose / Pitch Shift effect\" for the Mixxx software. Primarily, it allows a user to use a much wider range, than the Pitch Shifter for the deck player and, of course, other useful options like Formant Preservation or semitone chromatic scale mode. Due to the produced latency based on the pitch processing, the production delay has to be handled for the Dry/Wet and Dry+Wet modes to ensure that the original (dry) and processed (wet) signals overlap.

          "description": "Lately various AI driven algorithms have been published that are able to extract single instrument recordings (STEM) from an audio track file. Native Instruments has introduced an open definition for stem files STEMS to store these extracts. A Stem file contains the original a stereo track and four additional channel with the musical elements: A drums stem, a bassline stem, a melody stem and a vocal stem, in a m4a container.\n\nCurrently Mixxx is only capable of playing the stereo track. The goal of this project is to extract all channels and allow the user to mix them individually. In a fist version the Stem mixer can replace the equalizer in the Mixxx GUI. In an advanced version an integration with effects system is desired.",

This project proposes a complete rework of genre metadata handling, introducing three key features: local genre autocompletion with fuzzy matching, support for assigning multiple genres to a single track, and optional online genre suggestions using MusicBrainz and Discogs APIs. As a long-term extension, the project also explores a customizable genre mapping layer, enabling users to define how external genres are grouped or renamed according to personal preferences. Deliverables include: a redesigned genre database schema, enhanced UI for editing and filtering genres, API integration for genre lookups, and internal tools for mapping and translation of genre labels.",

While it provides exceptional quality in separating audio into stems, it is currently implemented in PyTorch and therefore cannot be used directly in C++ applications or run efficiently on hardware accelerators through ONNX Runtime. This project aims to bridge that gap.\n\nExporting the model to ONNX will allow Mixxx to integrate stem separation directly into its platform, opening up use cases like live stem manipulation, AI-assisted mixing, and educational visualization tools. Moreover, embedding the model in a minimal C++ command-line application will serve as a reference for further integration into audio applications.",
