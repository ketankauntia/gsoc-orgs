Vox.GL hopes to make these opportunities arrive with software freedom too.</p>\n<p>This position requires a clean, functional product to be available, which Vox.GL is currently anything but. As part of GSoC 2016, I will improve functionality of Vox.GL's build system, diagnose and fix existing graphical and input glitches, and push into fleshing out the core framework that will comprise the fully featured Vox.GL ecosystem. This includes entities, levels/chunks, storage, graphics, controllers/input options, packaging, physics and scripting. The completion of GSoC 2016 focuses on five main tasks: Fixing existing bugs, worlds and rendering infrastructure, entities and physics. With additional work as time permits.</p>\n",

The player has a crystal that allows them to switch gravity between the vectors (0, ,9.8, 0) and (0, -9.8, 0). This would be implemented using the soy.fields.Accelerate class. The player will progress through three levels, dodge enemies, and fight a final boss to win. The camera follows the player object by calculating the difference in the X values and each frame smoothly matching the camera’s X value to the player object.</p>\n<p>I’d like to really show off what the engine can do graphically. Specifically, I would like to use the soy.bodies.mesh object to show more complex models then shape primitives. I would also like to use the triplanar material class soy.materials.triplanar to add more detail through bump and glow maps. In addition, I am developing a Blender add-on to export 3-D models from Blender into the custom PySoy mesh format.</p>\n",
