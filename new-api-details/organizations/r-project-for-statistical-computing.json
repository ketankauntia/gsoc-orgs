Most applications are in the fields of volatility modeling, systemic risk measurement, macroeconometrics, credit risk analysis and dependence modelling.\nThe GAS package will offer the possibility to practitioners and academics to estimate GAS models using their data, perform predictions and simulations and obtain a graphical representation of the results. The data available at www.gasmodel.com will also be included for comparative and education purposes. The code will be written principally in C++ for computational purposes and then linked with R using the Rcpp, RcppArmadillo and RcppGSL packages.

Materials of interest could include roadways, vegetation, and specific targets (i.e. pollutants, hazardous materials, etc.). Trivially, each pixel of a hyperspectral image could be compared to a material database to determine the type of material making up the pixel. However, many hyperspectral imaging platforms have low resolution (&gt;5m per pixel) causing each pixel to be a mixture of several materials. The process of unmixing one of these 'mixed' pixels is called hyperspectral image unmixing or simply hyperspectral unmixing.\nThere is an R package for this purposes however, the already implemented methods N-FINDR and VCA make one crucial assumption: they assume the presence of pure spectra of all components are available somewhere in the data. Obviously, while this assumption is reasonable for some applications, other applications exist where this assumption should not be relied on. ICE algorithm does not need to have pure component spectra for the endmembers in the presented data. Vignettes are also required to provide datailed explainitaions of algorithms and examples.</p>\n",

As a distinguishing feature, styler is not supposed to operate on hard-coded formatting rules, but on a set of rules that can changed to support various coding conventions.</p>\n",

The second, perhaps equally important, is to showcase how NIMBLE can serve as a computational engine “under the hood” of an R package, and to develop extensions to NIMBLE that will support its use in this way.  The proposed package, called nimbleEcology, will provide a unified framework that allows users to model a variety of ecological process with a simple specification of the model structure, and estimate them using efficient and customizable MCMC samplers.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Modeling the volatility of financial markets is central in risk management. A seminal contribution in this field was the development of the GARCH model by Bollerslev (1986) where the volatility is a function of past asset returns. The GARCH model is today a widespread tool in risk management. However, recent studies show that estimates of GARCH models can be biased by structural breaks in the volatility dynamics (Bauwens et al., 2010; Bauwens et al., 2014). These structural breaks typically occur during periods of financial turmoil. Estimating a GARCH model on data displaying a structural break yields a non-stationary estimated model and implies poor risk predictions. A way to cope with this problem is provided by Markov-switching GARCH models (MSGARCH) whose parameters vary over time according to some regimes. These models can quickly adapt to variations in the unconditional volatility level, which improves risk predictions (see Ardia, 2008).</p>\n",

They are determined by a Lévy seed and trawl function, which can be viewed as a news impact curve. The major advantage is that the marginal distribution can be modelled separate from the trawl function, allowing for a very flexible modelling of the autocorrelation structure exhibiting short or long memory. This class of processes has recently been applied in high frequency econometrics where it is used to describe the behaviour of financial spreads and price processes at ultra high frequencies.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no open source code available to replicate any of the recent academic research. Similarly, practitioners wishing to apply these methods have no dependable source code to rely on. This project aims to change this by building a coherent simulation and estimation framework for both univariate and multivariate trawl processes. With this R package, users can apply the novel methodology to any application of interest, without having to worry about implementing the methods first. This way, research in trawl processes and the list of possible applications can only grow.</p>\n",

Deconstructions of time that respect the linear progression of time like days, weeks and months are defined as linear time granularities and those that accommodate for periodicities in time like hour of the day or day of the month are defined as circular granularities or calendar categorisations. Often visualising data across these circular granularities are a way to go when we want to explore periodicities, pattern or anomalies in the data. Also, because of the large volume of data in recent days, using probability distributions for display is a potentially useful approach.The project will provide these techniques into the tidy workflow, so that probability distributions can be examined in the range of graphics available in the ggplot2 package.</p>\n",

Moreover, tCNN uses the different convolutional layer to capture different taxonomic rank (e.g. species, genus, family, etc).

Currently, this methods are used widely and their applications include disease risk mapping, climate change risk predictions, conservation biology, among others. Physiological data suggests that Grinnellian niches are convex in nature and they may probably have an ellipsoidal form when multiple dimensions are considered. However, among the available software in the field, algorithms to model ecological niches as ellipsoids in the environmental space are scarce. Several analyses, not currently available, can be performed assuming ellipsoidal niches, especially if recent  literature is considered.

Planning adequate survey systems is challenging as not only geographical factors influence species distributions. Species distributions depend on complicated relationships between accessible areas, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As a survey aims to register species in a region, biotic interaction could be overlooked. However, the relationship between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for biodiversity sampling.

However, there is no framework in R for systematically testing the empirical computational complexity of functions, which tends to be a problem because such a testing framework could be essential for identifying big speed gains in R code as well. \nIn response to improve the stated, this project brings a new package 'testComplexity', which provides a suite of functions that will be useful for testing and thereby improving the speed (via code optimization) of various algorithms/functions in R. \nIt quantifies the runtimes for an algorithm, classifies its time complexity trend, tests for an expected complexity class and plots the benchmarked results to help visually conceive the results. Additionally, other features such as quantifying memory allocations, subsequently predicting the space complexity class and classifying complexity for user-defined output parameters (apart from time/memory cases) have been implemented.\nSince algorithms are used in every sphere of research, this package potentially caters to all types of R-users.</p>\n",

However, none, to our knowledge, have addressed the issue of robustness toward additive outliers, rather than innovations outliers. Muler and Yohai (2008) proposed two approaches to robust GARCH(p,q) model fitting to avoid bias in the parameter estimates and the preceding kind of over-estimation of volatility following isolated large outlier returns. In the first approach, parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood function using a modified likelihood function based on a bounded loss function. The second approach improves on the first by using a filter that limits the effect of an additive outlier on subsequent predictors of conditional variance. Our proposal is to implement the two approaches by exposing interfaces to a C++ library that can be called from any higher level language for estimating the likelihood functon. We will first develop an R implementation of the robust GARCH(p, q) fitting method, with application examples, and evaluate the performance of the code using as bench- marks selected simulation results from Muler and Yohai.</p>\n",

Automation of the performance evaluation process can lead to a significant reduction in human efforts and time consumption with an unbiased comparison environment. \n\nThe imputeTestbench package provides a benchmarking tool for automated performance evaluation and comparison of various imputation methods for time-series datasets. In its present form, the package is capable of handling time-series and temporal datasets. Imputation plays a crucial role in the fields of genetics and genomics. The aforementioned package can be very helpful if it can be modified to handle genetic or genomics datasets.

In August, to improve the user experience of the \"You Draw It\" tool, I will add tool tips to the shiny applet that will explain tasks and help educate users on using the tool.

This is achieved by visualizing low(er) dimensional projections of the data. As tours aren’t just singular projections, but rather sequences of projections, an integral part of the tourr package focuses on animating tours. In its current implementation, the package doesn't offer interactivity to guide the tours towards projections of particular interest. Previous efforts have been made to add interactivity; however, the resulting software suffered from performance issues or didn't provide the desired level of interactivity. Python packages such as matplotlib or tkinter offer the desired interactivity at a high efficiency. \n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop software that seamlessly integrates the interactivity available through Python with the tourr package written in R. To achieve that, the packages reticulate and rpy2, which provide tools for interoperability between Python and R, will be used. Furthermore, a wrapper for the tourr package will be developed in Python that will make tourr more accessible to the Python community. Finally, a technical documentation as well as a vignette for the developed code will be produced.",

This is especially true in quantum physics, where groundbreaking findings and complex concepts are emerging at a rapid pace, demanding constant attention and analysis from researchers. There is a dire need for AI that can efficiently process and summarize these vast volumes of scientific papers, helping human researchers focus their efforts on the most promising areas of investigation.\n\nThe problem of knowledge overload and the need for efficient systems to navigate and synthesize vast amounts of literature is not unique to quantum physics. In fact, it is a pervasive challenge across various academic and scientific disciplines, including statistics and data science – the very fields that led to the development of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models.\n\nThe exponential growth of research papers, coupled with the rapid advancement of statistical methodologies and data-driven approaches, has created a significant knowledge bottleneck in these domains. Researchers and practitioners in statistics and data science often struggle to keep up with the latest developments, hindering their ability to effectively leverage cutting-edge techniques and methodologies in their work. This knowledge overload problem has motivated the development of AI-powered systems like LLMs and RAG models, which aim to streamline the process of knowledge discovery, synthesis, and dissemination.\n\nBy adapting the proposed \"AI Scholar\" system to the domains of statistics and data science, researchers in these fields could benefit from personalized recommendations, automated literature analysis, and idea generation capabilities, ultimately accelerating the pace of innovation and fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration.",

It has been widely used in research for its ability to simulate missing data scenarios and evaluate multiple methods side-by-side. However, its current scope is limited to univariate data and lacks the performance and flexibility needed for more complex real-world applications.\nThis project proposes a major upgrade to the imputeTestbench package by extending its capabilities to multivariate time series, improving its computational performance, and adding a modern, interactive user interface via Shiny. The new version will also support advanced imputation techniques, including machine learning and deep learning-based approaches, and provide options for distributed computation using tools like Apache Spark.",

However, current tools for understanding the behavior of these indices under varying data conditions are limited. This project aims to enhance spinebil by developing diagnostics that assess how PP indices behave under noise, structure, varying sample sizes, and scale interpretation.\n\nI will implement routines to test index performance across noise-to-structure transitions, evaluate index value ranges, analyze sample size sensitivity, and apply these diagnostics to both existing and scagnostic-based indices (e.g., stringy, skinny). I will also optimize the code for performance and clarity, write detailed documentation and a vignette, and design a hex sticker for the package to support its identity on CRAN.\n\nThis project will support the development of more robust, interpretable projection pursuit indices and make spinebil more accessible to researchers, educators, and developers.",
