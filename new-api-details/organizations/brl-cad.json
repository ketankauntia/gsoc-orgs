So for the purpose of solid modeling, it is commonly impractical to represent these thin solids exactly as bounded volume, thus an available approach is to assign an implicit thickness to each face and then we can consider the thickness as a face property. Simply speaking, when shooting a ray towards the B-rep model, we can get ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit point from a face while the ‘out’ hit point is a small offset from the ‘in’ one with given thickness value along the ray direction.</p>\n",

Thus we require some programmatic method to heal meshes which are defective. There are quite a few features already present to heal meshes, but these are not sufficient. Hence, the project. Existing features include: removal of unused and exactly duplicate vertices, dangling edges, decimation of edges, and fusing of equivalent faces. The features that will added are: checking manifold connectivity, removal of gaps, T - joints, overlaps, large holes, and degenerate triangles.</p>\n",

The input fields in the dialog box are further categorised and presented in the form of tabs. User can easily switch to any tab to see contained input fields, thus enriching the experience by keeping the natural flow of user.

These releases will be tested before they are uploaded to Github/Snap Store.\n\nIf you are interested in how I plan to execute this objective feel free to open the Pdf, where there is my personal information, the detailed implementation of this automatization of releases and more!\n\nI've done two drawings describing it overall, the first one is the user vision which is the one I've described here(https://imgur.com/a/XGOmMM6) and the other one is the implementation diagram (https://imgur.com/a/KMgPU9V).

It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data.\n\n\nBlender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process.\n\n\nAn equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible.\n\n\nSome of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case. Since the IFC schema is very large, and often difficult to grasp for new users, emphasis will be on integrating the concepts of IFC into a typical design process in a natural manner and communicating the relevant information comprehensively to the user.",

The project will include updating the Boost C++ Libraries to the latest version and ensuring compatibility with other dependencies, including OpenEXR, OIIO, Embree, and Qt. Updating Appleseed to Python 3 may affect some of its dependencies, including Boost, PySide/PyQT, PIL, and other Python dependencies.

A MSVC based build has instructions circa 2012, but with significant changes in project structure, and updated/new third party libraries and dependencies, it would be useful to work on adding modern MSVC build support for Windows. Currently, most CI builds use MSYS2 instructions, which has a Unix style build system. The benefits of adding support for MSVC builds include having executable and library outputs (.exe/.dll), vcpkg support for third party libraries OpenSCAD depends on, and support for parallel builds for speed.",
