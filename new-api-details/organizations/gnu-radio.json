Currently, most operators rely on standalone applications like WSJT-X, limiting flexibility and integration possibilities.\nThe proposed solution is to create modular, reusable components for encoding, modulating, demodulating, and decoding FT8/WSPR messages. These components will include:\n\nFT8/WSPR Message Encoder: Implementing standard message formats with validation for callsigns, grid locators, and signal reports\nFT8/WSPR Modulator: Building 8-FSK modulation for FT8 and 4-FSK modulation for WSPR with proper timing and tone spacing\nFT8/WSPR Demodulator: Creating components to detect signals, handle frequency drift, and extract weak signals from noise\nFT8/WSPR Message Decoder: Implementing error correction algorithms and partial decode support\nIntegration Components: Developing example flowgraphs, time synchronization, and potentially QSO tracking features\n\nThis module will allow experimentation with weak signal protocols, enable integration into complex signal processing chains, provide educational value for understanding digital mode implementation, and support development of new applications leveraging these protocols—ultimately bringing more skilled contributors to the GNU Radio community.",

This ensures a robust, fully tested, and documented library, enabling researchers and hobbyists to build end-to-end flowgraphs entirely in GR4. Deliverables include:\n\n1.An OOT module with ported AM/FM demodulators, core digital modems, and real-time audio blocks\n\n2.Thorough unit tests (GoogleTest) & CI integration\n\n3.Example flowgraphs demonstrating real-world use (FM radio receiver, QPSK transceiver)\n\n4.Comprehensive documentation, including an official “Porting GR3 Blocks to GR4” guide and merged PRs for upstream adoption\n\nBy completing these tasks, the project will significantly expand GR4’s usability, help new adopters migrate confidently, and further solidify GNU Radio 4.0 as a high-performance, modern SDR framework.",
