But this is not a constraint. Working on other tasks would be equally great. In particular the first <strong>four projects</strong> listed on your page are pretty interesting. Also <strong>\"Detached Signatures\"</strong> would be good but i understand that maybe it's a bit too small for a complete GSoC. Maybe it can be good for the bonding period.</p>\n<p>All the other details are present in the complete proposal. Thank you.</p>\n<p>I hope to spend the summer on OpenKeychain with a <strong>GSoC 2016 project :)</strong></p>\n",
