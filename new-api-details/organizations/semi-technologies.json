Even though there are various other options to interact with a Weaviate instance, we cannot simple neglect the importance of a CLI. A CLI can be a lot faster and efficient than any other type of interface. It can also handle repetitive tasks easily. A CLI requires less memory to use in comparison to other interfaces. By adding more functionalities to the CLI we can increase it’s usability for the end user. This section describes some the existing functionalities of the CLI with their scope of improvement, and also proposes new functions to be added to the CLI. New functions and improvement is not limited to proposed functionalities below and more features can be added to the CLI in project duration.",
