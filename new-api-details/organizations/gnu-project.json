Ultimately, 'annotate' offers a comprehensive functionality that hasn't yet been achieved in traditional/commercial softwares, and which will benefit a range of engravers from amateurs and individuals to professionals and group settings.</p>\n",

This proposal completes work started as a Summer of Code project in 2016.</p>\n<p>A Javascript Backend will allow Guile users to run Guile Scheme, and other Guile based languages, in modern browsers merely by changing the build process for their programs. Usings the tools already built into Guile, this allows Guile to act as the full stack for small scale web sites, and provides a path for Guile based software like GNU Lilypond to be run on the web.</p>\n<p>It also provides further validation of Guile's Compiler Tower design, showing that backends can be written as easily as front ends.</p>\n<p>In a previous summer of code, I was able to compile a large portion of the cps language to Javascript and ported a large section of boot-9 (Guile's basic prelude), which meant I could run programs of some complexity, including using continuations for search, and mutually recursive numerical programs. This project will take it from an interesting toy to something we could confidently include in Guile.</p>\n",

Additional goals include inventory management, where the seller can configure the available stock for an item and will get notified when their stock runs low.

Browsers typically run JavaScript, which is single-threaded and relies on asynchronous events to avoid blocking the main thread, making the current implementation unsuitable. The proposed solution is to use a QTimer to periodically update the fractal using UIH functions.

It allows users to safely backup keys by giving shares to various independent escrow providers, and recover the secret by passing user-selected authentication challenges at a sufficiently large subset of these providers. GNU Taler is a digital payments system that uses cryptography to provide a certain degree of anonymity when paying things online.\n\nSome of the private keys that GNU Taler uses to represent money must be stored locally in the wallets, and thus, it is important to provide users with a way to ensure availability and confidentiality of these keys to avoid financial loss.\n\nThis proposal consists on the integration of GNU Anastasis in the Android wallet app of GNU Taler in order to allow users to make secure and decentralized backups of their digital wallets, and to recover the wallet data without relying on the user to safeguard their key material.\n\nGNU Anastasis' client logic is already available in TypeScript, just like the cryptographic core of the GNU Taler wallet.  Thus, to make this work, we need to link the GNU Anastasis client logic into the GNU Taler wallet and then systematically expose its functionality to the user interface implemented in Kotlin.\n\nIdeally, the resulting code should be re-usable outside of the GNU Taler wallet, for example as a stand-alone Android app to backup other key material or as re-usable Android dialogs that can be integrated with other Android apps in need for key backup and recovery functionality.",

After comprehensive assessment and analysis of these issues by the developers, the developers have determined that the current code responsible for those capabilities  should be rewritten and refactored.\n\nThe reason that note subdivision and beaming can be difficult to implement is that music theory heavily relies on powers of 2 and their reciprocals. It's very convenient to composers, instrument players and developers too. That convenience doesn't address the problems rhythmic complexity can pose. Concepts such as compound time signatures, tuplets (group of notes that are not bounded by the powers of 2) and manually setting relevant Lilypond attributes. My project proposes a new way of  representing the concept of music theory beams and groupings with different object attributes.\n\nMy project proposes to fix this Lilypond issue by rewriting `lily/beaming-pattern.cc` (the C++ source file mostly responsible for this issue's logic) and fixing/refactoring relevant C++/Scheme source files. I plan to first refactor such source files to fix regular note automatic subdivision and beaming, then fix tuplet subdivision in later weeks. Heavy code modifications will include updating documentation, adding regression tests, and formatting Lilypond's `convert-ly` rules corresponding to the above two issues.\n\nOnce the issue of beaming subdivisions is fixed, developers and even anyone wishing to compose rhythmically-complex scores should not have to worry about this obstacle.",

Currently, there is no official Rust support for GNU/Hurd, which limits developers' ability to build high-performance, safe, and concurrent software on this platform. The Rust language is increasingly being used in fundamental libraries such as librsvg and python-cryptography, so it is crucial to have a compiler for Rust on GNU/Hurd. The Rust compiler is portable, but its runtime library, libstd, needs to be ported to GNU/Hurd. This involves telling Rust how to call standard C library functions, which can be generated from libc C headers using the bindgen tool. The proposed solution involves creating a new Rust target for GNU/Hurd by investigating the system calls and interfaces available in GNU/Hurd and adapting Rust's code generator to generate code that uses these interfaces. The project aims to optimize Rust's performance on the GNU/Hurd platform by identifying performance bottlenecks and implementing improvements where necessary. The deliverables of the project include the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain, which comprises the Rust compiler and libraries, documentation, and optimized performance of Rust on the GNU/Hurd platform. The project also includes researching the GNU/Hurd system, identifying the system calls and interfaces that Rust will need to use, and creating documentation for the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain.",

The core secret itself is protected from the escrow providers by giving each provider only part of the information, and additionally by encrypting it with an identity-based key unknown to the providers. It prioritizes user privacy by implementing strong cryptographic protocols and privacy-enhancing features. Anastasis comes with an Android app.\n\nThe GNU Taler Wallet is a software developed within the GNU Taler project. It serves as a user interface for managing digital payments and transactions securely. The app enables users to store digital currency, make payments, and monitor transaction history. Taler Wallet also comes with an Android app.\n\nThe goals of the project are to design and implement:\n1. A mechanism to allow any app to save its secret keys via Anastasis app.\n2. A mechanism to allow any app to make its users pay for its services via Taler Wallet app.\n3. A feature in Anastasis app that allows its users to pay the backup providers for their service via Taler Wallet app.",

The communicator will be implemented using the nghttp3, ngtcp2 and TLS libraries. Currently, GNUnet has implemented HTTP/2 plugin using curl and microhttpd under the old TRANSPORT architecture. This project will build on this existing code by introducing nghttp3 and ngtcp2 to implement a faster and better communicator HTTP/3 for the new TNG architecture. \nI will stay in close contact with my mentors and do my best to complete this project, and I am eager to continue contributing to GNUnet after GSoC 2024.",
