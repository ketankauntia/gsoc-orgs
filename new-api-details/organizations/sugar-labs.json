To get started with “music blocks”, newbies need to have a fundamental understanding of the software, what are the things can be done and importantly how things can be done. To address this requirement, “music block” has a user guide. But the existing user guide lacks most of the important information about the software components,  how each building blocks in the software can be related to music and especially some examples of how to create music with the software. The objective of this project is to create a user manual which would be a simple and comprehensive guide while providing samples and related explanations. Deliverables of the project will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the Music blocks user guide content to be easily approachable to newbies. </li>\n<li>Implement a documentation website for Music Blocks user guide. </li>\n<li>Prepare a downloadable version of the Music Blocks user manual in Portable Document Format(PDF).</li>\n<li>Make the website expandable for online contributions to documentation from the website itself.</li>\n</ul>\n",

The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance.\n\nThe v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance.\n\nThe proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the \"Project Builder\", which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The Project Builder is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus.\n\nBy implementing the Project Builder feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version (v1) and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.",

Next, the project will tune and benchmark the LLM to generate high-quality musical compositions in ABC format. Once tuned, the LLM will be deployed to a server environment, and API endpoints will be set up to enable interaction with MusicBlocks. Users will initiate compositions in MusicBlocks, which will be sent to the LLM for enhancement. The LLM will generate multiple compositions based on the user's input, which will be converted back to MusicBlocks format for further enhancement. Throughout the project, integration testing and flow testing will ensure seamless interaction between MusicBlocks and the LLM API. Comprehensive documentation will provide insights into the implementation process, results of benchmarking and testing, and recommendations for future improvements. This integration of AI-generated compositions into MusicBlocks aims to inspire creativity, deepen musical understanding, and enhance the learning experience for users",

The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance. The v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance. The proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the \"Masonry Framework\" (previously code-builder/project-builder), which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus. By implementing the Masonry feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version (v3) and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.",

It will allow users to toggle between different layers, interact with body structures dynamically, and engage in real-time collaborative learning through a dedicated \"Doctor Mode.\" Additional features such as interactive quizzes, UI/UX refinements, and localization support will ensure accessibility and usability across different regions and devices.\n\nThe second component, the Stickman Animation Activity, will introduce an interactive keyframe animation tool where users can manipulate a stick figure by adjusting its nodes to create animations. This tool will support essential animation features such as playback, speed control, and exporting animations as videos. It will also include a collection of pre-designed templates for common movements like running, jumping, and dancing. A standout feature of this activity is the ability to import a photo of a human body and generate a corresponding stick figure in the same pose using AI-assisted pose detection.\n\nBy the end of the project, Sugar Labs will gain two fully functional, optimized, and localized activities that provide immersive learning experiences in human anatomy and animation principles. The enhancements to the 3D Human Body Activity will enable students to explore anatomy in a more interactive and engaging way, moving beyond static textbook images to dynamic 3D models. The Stickman Animation Activity will encourage creativity and spatial understanding by allowing students to experiment with motion and animation concepts.

The Speak Activity, traditionally used for promoting reading skills through synthetic speech, will be upgraded to provide a more natural and interactive experience.\n\nThe primary objective is to implement an LLM-based chatbot offering improved conversational abilities and a more human-like interaction style. For the voice feature a high-quality, natural-sounding Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that accurately handles pronunciation and phonetics will be used. By fine-tuning the LLM to manage invented spelling and grammatical inaccuracies, the chatbot will offer a supportive and child-friendly interaction, guiding learners in an encouraging manner.\n\nThe project will utilize Python and a fine-tuned model hosted on the cloud and accessed via an API endpoint. This design ensures compatibility and seamless integration with the existing Speak Activity, without adding extra dependencies.\n\nTo support offline functionality, a lightweight, fine-tuned fallback model will be packaged with the activity. This fallback ensures continued usability even without an internet connection, albeit with slightly less accurate responses compared to the cloud-hosted model.\n\nThis enhancement will make the Speak Activity a more effective and child-friendly tool, promoting better language learning through engaging and conversational interactions.",

This challenge limits the platform’s educational potential. To address this, the project proposes an AI-powered debugger that will analyze user projects, detect errors, and provide real-time, context-aware solutions. By leveraging open-source LLMs like LLaMA 3 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the debugger will understand Music Blocks-specific issues and offer structured guidance, helping users learn while troubleshooting.\nThe solution involves developing a JSON-to-text converter to interpret project structures, training an LLM on curated Music Blocks datasets, and implementing RAG to fetch relevant documentation and examples. A user-friendly debugger widget will be integrated into the Music Blocks interface, enabling seamless interaction with features like error detection, step-by-step explanations, and creative suggestions. The backend will use FastAPI for efficient API handling and AWS for scalable deployment, ensuring the system remains responsive and accessible to users worldwide.\nThe debugger will empower users to independently troubleshoot projects, enhance learning, and make Music Blocks more accessible. By combining AI with guided problem-solving, it aligns with Sugar Labs’ mission to foster creativity and education through open-source tools.",

Upon successful implementation, the turtle/mouse glyph will be able to detect the color of pixels underneath it, regardless of whether those pixels were drawn by the turtle/mouse itself, part of an uploaded image stamped to the canvas, or part of a live webcam video feed into Music Blocks. One test of success is to run our Lego music notation for the blind project with a live feed.
