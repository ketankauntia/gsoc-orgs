This will enable the user to highlight their favorite/important files with the color of their choice.\n\nXfce also offers a terminal application called Xfce-Terminal. My project also includes working on Xfce-Terminal to introduce Profiles. Currently all settings in Xfce-Terminal are global. I will be adding the functionality and feature set to allow users to create profiles, amongst which they can quickly switch between across tabs. This allows the user to have different settings on different tabs/windows and simultaneously work with them.",
