That implies, using Server-side Rendering for faster page loading times (significantly low Time To First Byte), using web-sockets for real-time updates for incidents, comments and HTTP Long Polling for upvotes etc., migrating to more robust, scalable and available database solution, finally, decoupling it from Django views. Then we need to write consistent tests to validate different models and fields. Finally, an NFSW image classifier. Eventually, we will end up with cleaner code, sound application architecture of both frontend and backend, adding more tests and developing/revamping new features are the most obvious ones. This will not only make developing new features much more easier, cleaner and maintainable but will also dramatically improve user experience and take it to next level.</p>\n",

Initially, I had envisioned the project with Flutter completely for cross-platform support as it suited the project idea. But along my way, working out the details and developing the sample prototype for the project idea, I got to know that ‘Landmark Detection’ from the Firebase Vision API in particular wasn’t yet supported with Flutter. To make it work, I needed to write quite good amount of native code for both Android and iOS platforms. If we were use to use on-device processing, that would make the app itself heavy since we would need to train our own custom ML model with a lot of data as an user can try to detect a monument from any angle possible. All these points, got me to reject the idea of Flutter for the complete app development. But at the same time, Flutter really has some great benefits such as extremely good UX/UI development, smooth performance, faster productive development, multiplatform support for future using same codebase. So I thought why not develop a native Android application and integrate Flutter with it for the frontend work and some backend work binding as well if needed.</p>\n",

To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity.  There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as \"Extend Election Dates\", \"Restrict Past Dates\", \"Logout functionality\", \"Profile Edit\", and \"Improve the UI\".",

When two clients are connected on the same peer network, a connection is created using FPTP protocol. This project proposes to use rsa_encrypt to create a security layer over the FPTP layer. Hence the chat service is secure from other possible listeners on the peer network.\n\nSecure file sharing\nI propose to extend the messaging service with file sharing capabilities. We transcribe the file stored in the client’s local storage into raw metadata and securely stream the bytes to the connected client using the RSA encryption layer. The client checks for the file type using MIMETypes and decodes the bytes into the intended file. This implementation is expected to use the dart:convert library for encoding and decoding. The challenge which I aim to surpass is encoding the raw bytes through the RSA layer to ensure that unauthorized listeners cannot access the raw bytes.\n\nFile Viewing\nI propose to implement in app file previews for supported file types using open-file-x and also enable in app viewing for image and video file types.\n\nUser Discovery on a Local Network\nThe challenge here would be for the application to persist UIDs which can be advertised over the WiFi network. Flutter does not have the capability to access users connected to a WiFi network unless the application is the router. Hence I propose to use mDNS to allow the devices to broadcast their presence on the same network without needing a central server.",

          "description": "This project tackles the lack of transparency in tree-planting initiatives by developing a decentralized mobile application that leverages blockchain technology for verifiable and tamper-proof tracking. Each planted tree is minted as an NFT (ERC-721), storing critical metadata like geolocation, species, and planter details on-chain. To ensure authenticity, the system incorporates a community-driven verification mechanism where users can validate trees by submitting photo proofs stored on IPFS, earning tokenized rewards (ERC-20) for their participation. A key innovation is the use of geohash-based indexing, which optimizes location queries by dynamically adjusting precision based on map zoom levels, significantly reducing gas costs and improving performance. The app features an interactive map built with Flutter, displaying nearby trees with species-specific icons and enabling users to explore detailed records.\n\nTo address the issue of tree mortality, the project introduces legacy tokens—ERC-20 rewards distributed to planters who report deceased trees or submit maintenance updates like care photos and videos. Tree NFTs are transferable, with ancestry tracked to maintain historical records. For collective efforts, smart contract-based organizational tools allow groups to manage plantations, add members, and track contributions on-chain. Additionally, each tree is linked to a dynamic QR code stored on IPFS, enabling physical trees to be scanned for instant access to their digital records. By combining blockchain transparency, geospatial efficiency, and community incentives, this project establishes a scalable and trustless framework for global reforestation efforts.",

The platform will utilize smart contract-based escrow, a hybrid evaluation model (creator-led and judge-based), and a reputation-driven judge selection mechanism to ensure secure, fair, and transparent bounty resolution.\r\n\r\nFor StablePay, I will enhance its functionality to improve usability, security, and merchant control. Key improvements include selective crypto payment options, real-time dashboards, dynamic fee estimation, wallet integrations (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet), and UI/UX optimizations.\r\n\r\nDeliverables include:\r\n1. A fully functional decentralized bounty platform with smart contract escrow and reputation systems.\r\n2. Upgraded StablePay SDK with extended wallet support, merchant controls, optimized transaction handling, and improved developer tools.",

Key backend upgrades include implementing user-named face clusters, optimizing face clustering with dimensionality reduction, upgrading to YOLOv11 for better detection, adding GPU accelerated inferencing, and redesigning inefficient database schemas. On the frontend, a fresh modern UI using Radix UI will be introduced, along with a unified folder selection, an advanced search bar supporting face and object queries, object bounding box display, and user notifications. To ensure broader accessibility, the project will package and publish PictoPy on the Ubuntu Snap Store, Microsoft Store, and macOS Store, enabling seamless installation and updates. This will involve creation of CI/CD pipelines on the Github repository. Additionally, comprehensive documentation—including contributing guides, API references, and setup videos—will encourage new developers to contribute. These improvements will make PictoPy more user-friendly, scalable, and ready for widespread adoption.",

Inpact aims to solve this by building a unified, open-source platform where creators, brands, and organizers can discover each other, communicate effectively, manage deliverables, track milestones, and facilitate payments — all in one place.\n\nMy proposal focuses on building key modules of this system including an insight-rich dashboard, real-time communication panel, trust score system, and modular backend workflows powered by Supabase. The platform will also support advanced options like letting users plug in their own LLM API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) for personalized experiences. Payments will be handled through a pluggable gateway model allowing Stripe, Razorpay, or other providers based on region or deployment preference, while keeping the system fully open-source and configurable.\n\nDeliverables include:\n\nFrontend implementation of core user flows using Next.js and Tailwind\nSupabase schema design and integration for user data, communications, proposals, and trust scores\nTrust Score algorithm based on interaction history, disputes, and feedback\nReal-time messaging and dispute handling system\nSettings page for optional LLM API integration\nPluggable and configurable payments module with documentation\nComplete documentation for deployment, developer contribution, and onboarding\nBy the end of GSoC, the platform will offer a robust baseline for decentralized creator collaborations and be ready for community testing and iterative improvement.",
