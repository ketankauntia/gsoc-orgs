It is an open source test suite with the goal of performing conformance, functional, stress, and performance testing of the functions described in the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification. The test suite will be developed independent of particular implementations of the POSIX APIs. It is configurable to test any implementation by specifying include and library information. The purpose of this benchmark suite is the creation of tests that depend purely on POSIX APIs, thus leaving open the possibility of OS independence, although initial development is on Linux. NetBSD is one of these major stream operating systems. Thus, it would be cool if we can use this suite to test NetBSD, which also drives the evolvement of operating systems.</p>\n",

This also includes building releases, testing them and debugging the system files (written in C) to make them work. Currently, Anita only has support for qemu (and experimental support for running NetBSD as Xen DomU). Unlike BSD, Linux has a kernel module known as KVM, which allows a user space program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors and can be utilized by qemu to provide “KVM acceleration” when the target architecture is the same as host architecture. The lack of such support makes qemu really slow on NetBSD. Testing system installation on a wide variety of platforms is very crucial for any organisation that’s into OS business. It can be a frustrating task to do that manually, but, if neglected can be a make or break situation for the OS (adoption/marketing). Automated testing with Anita makes the job a cakewalk. Support for Xen and Virtualbox will further enhance the capabilities of Anita.</p>\n",

It will allow for a Raspberry Pi running NetBSD to take advantage of the dedicated graphics processor, which could be useful for other programs which currently use software rasterization to utilize OpenGL ES. Specifically, the project will be compatible with Mesa as-is, allowing existing programs which depend on Mesa for graphics API support to be able to support the Raspberry Pi's GPU under NetBSD. This will be solved by porting the existing driver to be managed inside a NetBSD loadable kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime when needed. When complete, this will allow for OpenGL ES programs which have been ported to NetBSD from Linux, and already utilize the GPU under Linux to similarly use the GPU under NetBSD, such as programs which can render a triangle, a teapot, and some games.",
