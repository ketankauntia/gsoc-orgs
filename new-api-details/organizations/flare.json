Each rule is matched against features that CAPA extracts from a program. Extracted features include file-level features such as strings, section names, imports, and exports and function-level features such as API calls, string and byte references, instruction mnemonics, and number constants.\n\nCAPA uses feature extractors, called \"backends\", to extract features from supported file types (PE, ELF, and .NET) and architectures (32- and 64-bit x86). Each backend is built around an existing tool or library that provides file parsing and disassembly capabilities. CAPA uses this to extract features. CAPA currently implements backends using Vivisect, IDA Pro, and dnfile.\n\nGhidra is a popular open-source disassembly framework with a robust API to access its analysis. Programs can interact with a wealth of information that includes parsed file formats and disassembled code. The goal of this project is to develop a Ghidra backend for CAPA using Python 3 (via Ghidrathon) and Ghidra’s scripting API. Users should be able to invoke CAPA such that it uses Ghidra’s analysis engine and/or invoke CAPA from within Ghidra.",

Currently, the project relies purely on static analysis of code structures to identify patterns. This project extends capa to work on dynamic execution data such as sandbox run traces or code emulation analysis.\n\nThe introduction of dynamic analysis to capa is set to make analyzing samples that feature anti-analysis techniques a much easier task. This is an issue of concern since a large number of distributed software nowadays gets packed with commercial or private packers, which means that capa would fail to profile these executables' capabilities successfully. However, this can be circumvented by introducing dynamic analysis to the problem, which it would enable capa to get a view of the program after it had been unpacked in memory, thereby making it possible to extract the capabilities from the executable at hand.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Add support for the future integration of several sandbox solutions by means of an associated feature extractor.\n2. Implement a feature extractor for the Cuckoo-based CAPE Malware Configuration and Payload Extractor.\n3. Introduce capa features that are specific to dynamic analysis (such as captured network traffic).\n4. Add dynamic-based support for function call arguments.\n5. Write novel rules that make use of the newly introduced dynamic capability extraction.",

Capa is an effective tool for identifying malware capabilities on the Windows platform, but currently lacks support for Android threats. With the surge in Android malware, attackers increasingly combine code obfuscation, native libraries (.so files), and anti-analysis techniques, limiting the effectiveness of traditional static analysis methods in detecting Android malware.\r\nI will extend capa by developing a new component called AndroidFeatureExtractor, which uses the Frida dynamic instrumentation framework to monitor Java and native code layer behaviors at runtime. The extracted behavioral features will be seamlessly mapped to capa's existing feature model, allowing security analysts to leverage the rule system they are already familiar with, while making appropriate adjustments for Android-specific execution environments. This project provides security researchers with a systematic feature extraction tool that can be used to design rules for identifying complex Android malware capabilities specifically designed to evade traditional detection.",
