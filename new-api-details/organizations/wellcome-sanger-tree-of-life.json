BlobToolKit is also capable of detecting contamination, which are DNA fragments in the genome assembly that belong to a different species.

Converting this pipeline to Nextflow will allow: (1) its integration into the programme’s bioinformatics infrastructure, and (2) an open source nf-core pipeline that can be used by the bioinformatics community.",

Take natural language queries and convert them to structured queries using the GoaT query syntax.\n2. Automatically select the most appropriate type of search to perform and return results as a natural language statement.\n\nThis will improve the overall user experience and abstract the complexity of the GoaT syntax from the end user.",

The tool will help researchers identify mosquito species faster and more reliably—boosting global malaria surveillance, guiding insecticide use, and advancing vector genomics research.",
