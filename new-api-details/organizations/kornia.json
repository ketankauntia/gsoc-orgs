  "description": "Kornia AI is a non-profit organization advancing Spatial Artificial Intelligence through open collaboration. Founded in 2018 and  registered as a non-profit in 2023, Kornia AI is supported by a global contributor community. The organization began with Kornia, a widely adopted Python library for Differentiable Computer Vision (>2M downloads/month, 400+ Google Scholar citations).\n In recent years, the core maintainers have shifted focus to kornia-rs, a native Rust stack for high‑performance 3D computer vision and spatial AI. Our direction emphasizes robotics and edge deployment: safe, memory‑efficient, low‑latency pipelines that run on constrained devices (e.g., embedded/Jetson‑class hardware). kornia-rs is gaining traction in the open-source community and is used by leading companies such as Farm-ng, Rerun.io, and Copper Robotics, who have featured the project on their platforms.",

Their ability to provide robust fiducial markers makes them valuable for tasks such as robot navigation, visual SLAM, and pose estimation. This project aims to implement efficient detection algorithms for both synthetic and natural features in Rust. It will include an April Tag detector—optimized for calibration and structured environments—and an ORB-based detector for natural feature extraction, which is crucial for robust visual localization and Visual SLAM applications. Both modules will be integrated into the kornia-rs ecosystem, thereby providing a comprehensive toolkit for camera calibration, localization, and robotics.",
