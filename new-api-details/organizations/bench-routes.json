The configuration is actually parsed from a file config.yml. We are required to make a new config design and a new parser package that will parse the new config design.</li>\n<li><strong>Revamping the design pattern and adding Scheduler</strong>\nBench-route monitor API endpoints by launching go-routines for each-endpoints with different workers concurrently. However, there are multiple problems with this system.We need to redesign the architecture of scraping the metrics with a dedicated scheduler for scheduling the go-routines.</li>\n<li><strong>Writing Querier package &amp; API Integration</strong>\nSince the base architecture of BenchRoute will be changed due to the last two ideas, the earlier APIs need to be changed with new APIs according to the client requirements. Also, a new TSDB has been integrated with the new Designs, hence querying data from TSDB requires a new Querier package.</li>\n</ul>\n",
