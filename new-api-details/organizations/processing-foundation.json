Due to internationalization (i18n), the p5.js website is built from templates that retrieve the text content from data files. The entire site is built with Node JS, Handlebars, and Grunt. There are three kinds of pages and each works differently: References, examples, and other web pages. References Pages are built-in English and swapped to other languages using JS on the front-end. Translation content is stored in a JSON object. For every new page, we need to create a key-value pair in the hi.yml file. A single JS template is also needed. Examples pages are built from templates with handlebars, while examples are stored in JS files. To implement i18n, new templates were created specifically for the Hindi language, so that Examples were rendered properly. Other pages are built from templates in which Handlebars point to the content in the actual language when rendered.</p>\n<p>The entire website is deployed and it is live at  <a href=\"https://p5js.org/hi/\" target=\"_blank\">https://p5js.org/hi/</a></p>\n",

In previous years, outreach and accessibility updates have been core goals of the showcase, so this project aims to expand the possibilities of how outreach and accessibility can be achieved.\r\n\r\nSubmissions will be encouraged to interpret the theme BONDS in their own ways, with emphasis on community, care, and thoughtfulness. As well, the ability to participate in and browse the showcase should not be hindered by one’s physical abilities, thus increasing accessibility will further BOND the community, especially in the parts of the community that are not as well represented.\r\n\r\nThis project will deliver three stages of changes: the community approach, the support, and the narrative. The community approach will implement a hashtag and social media challenge to expand community discussion/bonding beyond the showcase launch date. The support phase will focus on tweaking specific functions to greatly improve UI and accessibility, as good design will open up the p5 community/showcase to underrepresented communities, such as the impaired. Lastly, the narrative phase will introduce the implementation of an \"Explore\" tab alongside of the current \"Gallery\" tab, which will encompass a digital gallery that allows viewers to freely explore the works and create their own narratives, adding more personality/personal voice to each submission.",

While the WebGL components of p5.js are increasingly robust, there are a number of open issues that point towards some unexpected behavior and a lack of documentation around certain features. There is also the challenge of structuring the WebGL functions in a way that achieves parity with the p5.js approach to 2d rendering. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of bugs that I would like to resolve, including #5455, #5631, and #5440. For documentation, it seems necessary to make certain additions to better orient developers who are new to 3D graphics and shaders, including graphics quirks that go beyond p5.js, such as the depth sorting challenges mentioned in issue #5420. I would also like to contribute documentation that helps users better understand the structure of WebGL in p5.js, information that is currently only available within the contributor documents. Additional examples would also be helpful for topics like setting up an effects chain or for achieving certain effects such as feedback.",
