This eventually increases the probability of a variety of space events where some might be catastrophic while others serve as a source of beneficial information of scientific interest. As a result, it would be advantageous to detect such contingencies. The potentially harmful ones like orbital collisions can be prevented, and others would allow us to extract meaningful insights about the satellite dynamics. This would ultimately assist in devising optimal orbital design and maintenance strategies.</p>\n<p>The proposed project aims to add event detectors by implementing raw orbital algorithms allowing for increased efficiency and enhanced functionality and configuring them in high-level API. This would ensure swift processing of computationally intensive algorithms while simultaneously allowing to render an easy-to-use API to the user. Consequently, it would allow us to promptly recognize various intricate orbital mechanisms and formulate effective policies based on the outcomes.</p>\n",
