For this reason, it is crucial to guarantee a certain high quality of service (QoS). This QoS may be degraded by the presence of spurious undesirable signals coming from jammers that could degrade partially (or totally) the bandwidth of the desired GNSS signal.\nBasically, two kinds of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) can disturb a GNSS signal. Each one has its own characteristic spectral feature and a classification based on that is described as following:\n•    Continuous wave interferences (CWI): a perturbation of a relative small part of the spectrum and can be mitigated by means of a notch filter.\n•    Short pulsed interferences: with an instantaneous bandwidth that usually covers the entire GNSS band and can be partially removed by means of a blanking filter. \nTwo interference detection and mitigation algorithms will be evaluated in order to implement a new Signal conditioner block into GNSS-SDR. These algorithms will be coded in C++</p>\n",

The performance obtained with such architectures is sufficient for benign propagation scenarios, but typically deliver poor performance under harsh propagation conditions. Code and carrier tracking, as well as joint code/carrier synchronization, can be formulated as an estimation problem which can be solved using Bayesian filtering methods. It has been shown in the GNSS literature that KF-based synchronization solutions can be used to overcome the performance limitations of standard approaches, offering implicitly adaptive filter bandwidth, and opening up the possibility of using nonlinear models to avoid certain limitations associated with the use of code, phase or frequency discriminators. In this contribution, we will leverage powerful nonlinear tracking algorithms, including cubature, unscented, and sigma point Kalman filters in order to produce realizations of carrier and joint code-carrier tracking blocks which promise to be more effective and adaptable in challenging GNSS environments when compared to traditional architectures.</p>\n",

To mitigate those outliers,  robust version of cross-ambiguity functions (CAFs) are introduced with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator under heavy tailed distribution and M-estimator.

By developing acquisition and tracking blocks to capture these signals, precise positioning and advanced research on the ionosphere could be enhanced. \n\nAs a user with a year of experience using GNSS-SDR and GNURadio, the process of developing the required solution will be carry out in a better way. The expected time to complete the project is 350h, which can be splitted in these deliverable groups: \n\n1.- 50h: acquiring information about the problem and studying the way acquisition and tracking blocks work in GNSS-SDR. The type of signals, the way to decode messages and their structure, should be well understood before starting coding the solution. The proposed deliverable is a short presentation, in order to show this information to the mentors and after that, proceed with the coding. \n\n2.- 250h: the main block of the project. During this period, the solution has to be created in C++. The different processing blocks (acquisition, tracking, observables and PVT) must work at the end of the period for SBAS signals. The proposed deliverables are tracking and acquisition blocks working after the first 150h, and then the integration with the observables and PVT has to be demonstrated. \n\n3.- To conclude, the last 50h of project are dedicated to develop tests to demonstrate the robustness of the solution and to implement the code for real-time signals.",

          "description": "This project aims to implement a Vector Tracking Loop (VTL) architecture in GNSS-SDR, a widely used open-source software-defined GNSS receiver. Traditional scalar tracking architecture tracks satellite signals independently, limiting robustness in dynamic or degraded signal environments. In contrast, VTL integrates tracking and navigation tasks into a single algorithm, where all channels collaborate to enhance signal tracking performance, particularly under challenging conditions such as interference or temporary outages.\nThe proposed work will design and integrate a modular, configurable VTL architecture supporting multi-constellation and multi-frequency operation, aligning with the existing capabilities of GNSS-SDR. \nDeliverables include: VTL algorithm implementation, real-time feedback to tracking channels, multi-constellation and multi-frequency support, benchmarking, and documentation. \nThis contribution will enable researchers and developers to explore advanced GNSS techniques related to the VTL architecture within a real-time, open-source SDR.",

This will advance research on sensor fusion, enabling reliable high-accuracy navigation solutions in challenging environments such as the urban cannon. I will leverage state-of-the-art AI techniques, such as Bayesian filters (e.g., Kalman filters and particle filters), graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformers for spatiotemporal data modeling. The end product will consist of a functional prototype receiver which will implement the necessary algorithms.",
