What are the advantages to implement this interface into the Colibri\nproject? The grid operators have the possibility to inform the customer about e.g. the current\nenergy price, with this standardized interface. The customer can control his electrical consumers\nregarding the given information. Colibri with the OpenADR connection helps to automate this\nprocess on the customer side. The Colibri control module can reduce or increase the total power\nconsumption depending on to the information from the other smart grid agents. In the end this\nwill result in a more stable grid, because the energy producer and consumer will stand in an\ninterdependency. This also leads to an better usage of the energy resources which is a great benefit\nfor the society. Therefore it is a good idea to add this functionality to the Colibri project.</p>\n",
