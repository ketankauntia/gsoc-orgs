This project involves the development and performance evaluation of a Python interface that would allow more Python-based scientific codes to use and benefit from the asynchronous I/O.\nThe h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5 library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete wrapping of the HDF5 API.\nThe h5py package currently only supports synchronous I/O. And this project I am going to add the Asynchronous I/O.\n\nThe plan to solve it:\nMilestone 1: create a new Python API.\nMilestone 2: convert existing c tests to python tests.\nMilestone 3: test my implementation with the tests.\nMilestone 4: evaluate the performance with a scientific python application.\nWhen all tests pass we will have a usable Python interface for the asynchronous I/O.\n\nAn example: the H5Fcreate_async function:\nFirst, prepare the H5Fcreate_async.h file, H5Fcreate_async.c file, and we create the cyH5Fcreate_async.pyx file. \nSecond, use the command to Parse pyx source code into c code. \nNext, use some commands to compile c files into object files (*.o files)\nNext, use some commands to link multiple object files into dynamic link library files (*.so files)\nIn this way, the file of H5Fcreate_async.so is obtained, and then the library can be imported in the Python application.",

I collected feedback from them and the main struggles of students and newbies will be documented. This Wiki/Documentation proposed will cover everything that you need to start designing integrated circuits from scratch. Some amount of knowledge of Linux/Bash is assumed.  \n\n\nI want to elevate the pressure on Skywater’s slack as the base for discussion for issues by adding a troubleshooting guide. This will allow mentors in slack to have one go-to point for all of the most common issues that they can refer to.  \n\n\nAll of the tutorials and demos are text + screenshots posted on GitHub. This is because it’s easier to update them when new versions of software come out or if the existing guide does not cover a particular topic. Videos get outdated every 3-6 months and require an effort from contributors to support. The aim is to reduce the cost of documentation support.  \n\n\nAll documentation will be proposed to developers of the according to software to be integrated into existing software’s documentation. Link to the global guide is also encouraged to allow a single consolidated entry point.",
