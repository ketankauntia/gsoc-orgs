It is categorized as a formal verification system tool for the modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit probabilistic behavior.  Prism allows its users to plot the results of its various experiments graphically, but currently only a small range of graphs is supported. This proposal addresses the extension of the graphing capabilities of Prism by adding the support of many new 2D and 3D plots. This feature would enable the users of Prism to easily grasp and compare the results of the experiments run on this tool without having to go through the text output results. This project also addresses the enhancement of the general GUI of Prism. This would focus on making this tool more flexible and usable.</p>\n",
