This library is actively used when writing cross-platform graphical applications (mostly games). The previous version of the library, SDL 1.2, is already ported for KolibriOS, but there is no SDL 2 port, which is the most up-to-date and supported version.\n\nHaving support for SDL 2 in KolibriOS will not only allow developers to develop new applications using the updated functionality of the library, but also to port a huge number of existing open source programs (mostly emulators and games) from other platforms, because SDL 2 is often used to implement frontend/graphics in such applications. This will also allow to completely deprecate the current SDL 1.2 library as we can use a compatibility layer for applications relying on SDL 1.x.",
