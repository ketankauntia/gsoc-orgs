This shortcoming of Daru prevents data to be easily and to its full extent analyzed. This project aims to achieve just that.</p>\n<p>This project has broadly two goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First is to efficiently store and manage categorical data in a Data Frame. This will be done with the help of a new data type CategoricalData and a class CategoricalIndex dedicated for this purpose. It also involves easy visualization of categorical data with help of plotting functionality.</li>\n<li>Next goal is to update various statistical analysis such as regression in Statsample and Statsample-glm taking categorical data into account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On accomplishing both of these tasks, one would be able to see Data more clearly.</p>\n",

This re-implementation is having a fast core written using C-API with Ruby front-end. With this project, we aim to create a faster NMatrix which will replace the original NMatrix later on and the source would be simpler and easier to read and improve. This proposal is to add more features to this newer NMatrix such as adding support for LAPACK and BLAS routines, sparse matrix operations, indexing and broadcasting, matrix decomposition etc.</p>\n",
