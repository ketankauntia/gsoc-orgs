I also aim to develop a new parameter framework to improve the syntax of the API which is exposed to the user via SWIG. This would also make installing Shogun much easier (which is an important priority of Shogun community) as base library will be small and most of the features will be enabled by installing plugins for the base library with their own dependencies.</p>\n",

The dataset I will work with is the MIMIC database, which is comprised of information relating to patients admitted to the ICU at a large hospital. The data mainly includes demographic, administrative, and clinical data from over 45,000 critical care patients. The project will be divided into two parts: In the first part, I plan to perform data cleaning and apply various machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC dataset for mortality prediction, predict the risk of developing certain diseases, determine the effectiveness of certain drugs, and more. In the final part, I will explore more novel methods like LSTMs to exploit the time-series data. Recent research has shown good results of using deep learning on electronic health records.</p>\n",
