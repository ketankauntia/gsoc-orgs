Currently, all the search results are returned by the server corresponding to the set of search parameters specified by the user.

The current patient flag module has performance issue as it evaluates flags sequentially, this is leading to issues when dealing with multiple flags for a patient or group of patients. I propose evaluate these flag in parallel. This approach allows multiple flag evaluations to be performed concurrently, potentially improving performance compared to sequential evaluation. Furthermore, the module currently having methods with multiple database calls, such as saving multiple flags using a for loop, causing system slowdowns. To address this issue, I aim to reduce database calls through batch saving. The patient flag module does not compatibility with Java 11 and Java 17 and this module need to update to meet the current openmrs standards. Another objective of this project is to implement the FHIR flag resource in openMRS fhir module. In the project execution phase, first updating to Java 17 and revamping the patient flag module's code base, then addressing performance issues, and finally delivering FHIR flag resource mapping.",

This project proposes building a backend module that exposes audit log data in a meaningful way through a legacy UI-based audit log viewer, REST endpoints for external access, and an extension that tracks read operations on selected entities—something Envers does not support out-of-the-box.\n\nThe solution will include:\n\n1. Audit log retrieval and visualization within the legacy UI\n\n2. Custom tracking of read operations using Hibernate event listeners or an alternative approach\n\n3. Filtering capabilities (by user, date, and entity)\n\n4. RESTful APIs for external access to audit data\n\n5. A well-documented architecture, extensible to other OpenMRS modules\n\nBy the end of this project, OpenMRS administrators will have a comprehensive and usable interface to audit system activity, improving transparency, traceability, and compliance with healthcare data standards.",
