But the current design is limited to a single bot operating on direct channels.\nThis decision was made due to privacy concerns of bots answering with sensitive data. This project aims to improve the functionality and usability without compromising privacy.\nThis project consists of allowing multiple bots to be connected and operating on various use cases (channels, omnichannels and direct). It also aims to improve the UI by correctly rendering rich components (bots with interactive graphical capabilities). By developing these features we can not only focus on extending the Botpress Connector, but also on making these extensions a good foundation for other bot connectors\n\n\n-Deliverables\n\nMultiple bots can be configured with the Botpress Connector\nThe Connector can inform which channels the bot is responding to\nThe bot can answer on omnichannel, channels and direct\nWhen handling sensitive data, bots will respond with a direct message\nRich components correctly render for the agent",

This will save time and effort for developers who are new to app development and help them get started quickly.\n\n\nThe second feature is the implementation of a project concept where multiple screens can be grouped, saved, and revisited at a later time. This will enable developers to work on different parts of the app separately and easily switch between them.\n\n\nThe third feature is the use of the flow concept from https://reactflow.dev. This will allow each project to be represented as a flow, with each screen represented by a block. Actions can be connected to other blocks to visualise the app's lifecycle. This will make the development process more visual and easier to understand.\n\n\nThe last feature is the ability to \"compile the flow\" and run it as a demo. This will allow developers to quickly present a mock or app to validate its usefulness. This will save time and effort for developers who want to get feedback on their app quickly.\n\n\nOverall, Playground 2.0 is an app development platform that makes the development process faster, more visual, and easier to understand.

In this project, we propose to develop a Rocket.Chat app that enables the AI programmer functionalities where users can utilize the tool to create a short piece of code in C/C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript or Python based on specification supplied by the user. This implementation includes modern open source LLMs (Mistral, CodeLlama, WizardCode, Llama2, Phi, and so on) for a simplified configuration. This functionality also allows users to ask for a new variation of the code or augment/fine-tune the system for a more precise code generation. To achieve this, we propose to design a more intuitive and interactive UX to simplify users’ interaction. Finally, we will explore to bridge the generated codes with sharing APIs, allowing them to be shared to external applications and added to GitHub as a pull request. The AI Programmer app will be published on Rocket.Chat Marketplace together with specified documentation.",

Despite the evolution of systems like Rocket.Chat, email remains deeply entrenched in global workflows and communities. This project elegantly bridges this divide by creating a seamless interface that allows Rocket.Chat users to interact with email systems through natural language commands, bringing legacy email functionality directly into the Rocket.Chat environment.\n\nBy leveraging advanced LLM capabilities, this integration will allow users to perform complex email operations without leaving their Rocket.Chat conversations. The app responds to natural language instructions, enabling email tasks to be completed with simple, intuitive commands that feel like conversational requests.",

Users upload receipts into designated chat channels—each representing a specific event, time period, or trip—where the system validates the image, extracts structured data such as amount, date, and items, and categorizes expenses automatically. The processed data is stored persistently, allowing users to generate detailed spending reports in various formats (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or custom date ranges), filter by specific channels, or view overall spending. Additional functionalities include natural language query support, optional slash command integration to perform actions like showing receipt data. All designed to streamline financial tracking by minimizing manual input and enabling efficient, structured querying of expense data.",
