          "description": "Sometimes, in the context of quantum chemistry, the quantum state of a system in a crystal or molecule can be well described only by its occupation and/or spin operators. The goal of Model Hamiltonians, one of the APIs of the QC-Devs, is to create a framework for constructing the models and outputting them into a format that is possible for traditional Python packages solving Quantum Many-Body problems. \n\n\nIn some cases, it is more convenient to think only about the occupation number of an atomic (or functional moiety), which constitutes an occupation-based Hamiltonian. The most general occupation-number Hamiltonian we consider is the generalized Pariser-Parr-Pople + pairing (PPP+P) Hamiltonian. For some other phenomena, it’s convenient to write the Hamiltonian only in function of the spin operators. This constitutes the Spin-based Hamiltonians and can be exemplified by the Heisenberg model.\n\nOn the other hand, for some materials like superconductors, it’s necessary to combine both types of models at the same time, in a class known as occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, where the most known is the t-J-U-V model, which can be expressed as a sum of the Heisenberg XXZ and the PPP hamiltonian.\n\n\nThe package already includes implemented occupation-based and spin-based Hamiltonians. However, there is still a need for additional occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to implement occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, which involves the following steps:\n\n\n1. Establish a dictionary-based database to include standard constants defining various atoms and their connectivity types.\n2. Develop an API that integrates the existing code with the occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n3. Design and execute tests for the implemented API to ensure its reliability and functionality.\n4. Develop utility functions to generate model Hamiltonians in formats compatible with external programs, such as FCIDump and Triqs.",

AtomDB, a valuable resource for atomic data, currently relies on MsgPack for data storage, which presents challenges such as limited compatibility with version control, lack of support for schema evolution, and difficulties in debugging. This project proposes refactoring AtomDB by replacing MsgPack with PyTables, a hierarchical database package designed for managing large amounts of scientific data efficiently. The proposed implementation includes merging the SpeciesData dataclass into the Species class to simplify the structure and remove redundant methods, developing a robust migration script to convert existing MsgPack files into HDF5 format without data loss, and updating build configurations to include PyTables as a dependency. The refactored solution will undergo comprehensive testing and benchmarking to ensure improved maintainability, performance, and compatibility, preserving existing functionality while aligning more closely with modern scientific data management practices.",

          "description": "The efficient computation of molecular integrals is crucial for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations to obtain the properties of the system. Gbasis is a free and open-source Python library for molecular property calculations using Gaussian basis functions, which are commonly used in quantum chemistry. It can evaluate various functions expanded in a Gaussian basis set, such as the electron density, as well as integrals over Gaussian basis functions. For all of these computations, a large number of complex integrals must be evaluated. Gbasis can compute various one- and two-electron integrals, but as the system size increases, these integrations become increasingly time- and memory-intensive.\n\nScreening is common in computational chemistry, and most codes use it to skip unnecessary integral evaluations. Currently, Gbasis applies screening only to overlap integrals. The aim of this project is to extend screening to other one-electron and two-electron integrals. By evaluating different types of integrals, a variety of properties such as the electrostatic potential, electron density, and its derivatives can be obtained. These evaluations are typically performed on a spatial grid, and screening for such grid-based evaluations will also be addressed in this work.",
