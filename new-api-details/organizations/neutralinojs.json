While the community has developed technology for web-to-native app conversion and offers essential native APIs, there's a significant opportunity to improve the developer experience and platform capabilities. The main objective is to create a package enabling developers to write backend code in their preferred language, supporting multi-language capabilities, and integrating CLI support for seamless backend management. The overhaul includes refining documentation with clear examples and instructions, enhancing templates, and integrating best practices for streamlined development. Additionally, improvements to the CLI interface will provide a user-friendly experience. By addressing these aspects, the project aims to attract more developers, empower existing users, and establish Neutralinojs as a premier platform for converting web apps to native desktop applications.",
