The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. Open3D visualization does not work consistently on cloud notebooks such as Google Colab. This is due to a need to modernize the Open3D Jupyter widget as well as use CPU rendering when a GPU with graphics capability is not available in the cloud notebook. This will enable new users to start working with Open3D visualization quickly by directly opening tutorial notebooks in the cloud with no GPU devices.\nThis proposal is based on the original GSoC idea in https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2022#3-open3d-visualization-on-cloud-notebooks.",

First of all, functions related to surface reconstruction and geometry sampling will be wrapped to support the tensor-based module. Secondly, I will enhance the functionality of tensor-based geometry file IO capabilities, including geometry file IO module and geometry creation APIs. Besides, I intend to wrap other classes and functions to make the tensor-based APIs reach feature parity with the old APIs if time permits.",

Convert the PyTorch model to TensorFlow and verify the metrics on the Waymo dataset.\n• Once verified, train the model from scratch in TensorFlow and verify the results.",
