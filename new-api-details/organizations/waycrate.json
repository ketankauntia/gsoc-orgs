          "description": "I propose to work on the creation of a DMA-BUF backend for waycrate’s libwayshot screen capture library. Presently libwayshot’s method of screen-capture requires copying from graphics memory to system memory via CPU using the shared memory methods of the wlr-screencopy protocol. This method has too much overhead for uses like high resolution streaming: any further transforms and processing of the image will either be performed on CPU (inefficient) or require another copy back onto graphics memory. There is a better way to do this.\n\nThe DMA-BUF (short for Direct Memory Access Buffer) is a Linux kernel framework that allows for efficiently sharing buffers of memory between multiple graphics devices or subsystems. Using the DMA-BUF export mechanisms in wlroots we can completely avoid downloads and uploads between graphics memory and the CPU, thus allowing for increased efficiency and performance. This will be especially noticeable on higher resolution screen-captures where individual frame buffers become too large to be efficiently dealt with on a CPU compared to how they can be handled on the GPU.\n\nThe Deliverables for this project are: Complete implementation of a high-performance DMA-BUF based screen capture backend in libwayshot, Documentation for using it.",
