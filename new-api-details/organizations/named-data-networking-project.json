Furthermore, additional security measures and validation will be added to the application. To popularize the app, the UI and UX of the app will be brought up to standards and NDN theme will be incorporated into the application.</p>\n",

Given the current state of the app, being a prototype gives a big room for changes and improvements to be done in the coding period.</p>\n",
