There are three levels for BLAS: Level 1 is for vector-vector operations, Level 2 is for vector-matrix operations, and Level 3 is for matrix-matrix operations.\n\nI propose to add the Javascript, C, and free form Fortran implementations for the routines using the fixed form Fortran implementations available. For each package, I will add thorough benchmarks, comprehensive test suites, examples, and a README containing the API signatures for the routine in multiple languages, along with the ndarray case. I will also add the docs folder, which houses a repl.txt file, a typescript file that provides introductions, usage instructions to aid in documentation, and other files to check cases where the function may become invalid. A cblas wrapper will also be added for devices with support for cblas, such as AppleAccelerators, for hardware-optimized performance.\n\nThis implementation will open doors for domains such as time series analysis or linear algebra operations such as SVD that are built on top of these BLAS routines. A comprehensive suite of BLAS routine APIs will be incorporated into stdlib, and the integration of C and Fortran implementations will aim at optimizing performance and enabling potential hardware-based implementations.",
