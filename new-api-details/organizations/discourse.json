Providing links between Discourse’s ‘long format’ discussion and instant-messaging applications is a natural way to promote real-time engagement with users. The discourse-slack plugin implements this well, and extending this functionality to more providers can only increase user engagement. This needs to be done in a maintainable way and creating a ‘common event system’ for chatroom plugins is the best way to do this.</p>\n",

The benefit for the Discourse community is better filtering of posts with emphasis on the search performance which will be useful for searching in bigger forums.
