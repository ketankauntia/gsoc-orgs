While the framework is almost complete, it lacks a tool that can load, modify and export 3D assets in a suitable format so applications developed with RAMSES can use them at runtime. The following is my plan for the duration of the program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Produce a Blender export plugin capable of exporting 3D information from a Blender scene for use in a RAMSES application in the form of a RAMSES scene file.</li>\n<li>Expand GENIVI's Navigation Demo - which uses RAMSES - in a way it can use such tool to import 3D data for displaying on screen.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This was called “EmulationCore” and was capable of playing music and finding a location on the map based on user’s speech. Somewhat primitive methods were adopted to refine exact information from the user’s speech those of which have a greater possibility to fail. I intend to work on enhancing the speech recognition and the implementation of VCIVING on GDP.</p>\n",
