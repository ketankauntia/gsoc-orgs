          "description": "<p>This proposal consists of a few tasks that implement new features for Kapitan which I believe will add value to the software.\nTask 1: dependency management\nWith this feature, kapitan users will be able to fetch sources via HTTP[S] and/or git during compilation into specific targets. This will allow them to manage online dependencies much more easily.</p>\n<p>Task 2: support for Helm chart import\nThis will allow existing Helm users to import their charts into kapitan projects and render the charts together with the values set in the kapitan inventory to compile into a target. This integration will make it easy for users to switch to kapitan from Helm.</p>\n<p>Task 3: kapitan binary\nKapitan exists as a pip package to be used in CLI and as a Docker image. Users have pointed out that having a portable binary for Kapitan would be very helpful. This task aims to meet such needs by packaging kapitan into a static binary with the use of third-party build tools.</p>\n<p>Task 4: json schema validation for k8s\nKapitan, just as it has its own channel in k8s slack community, is used by a large number of k8s users. This feature enables pre-checking of compilation output of k8s configuration files.</p>\n",

This would allow users to combine different inventories from different sources and build modular infrastructure reusable across various repos.</p>\n<h3>Task2 : Support for Helm binding in OSX</h3>\n<p>This project can be subdivided into the following three tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the Helm binding pipeline so that continuous integration (travis) also builds binding for osx and releases them to GitHub release.</li>\n<li>Packaging the binding to the pypi release.</li>\n<li>Add a brew manifest for osx so that users there can install Kapitan in a simpler way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Task3 (bonus): Modularize kapitan</h3>\n<p>This project would modularize kaitan into core dependencies and extra modules.</p>\n<h3>Documentation and tutorial</h3>\n<p>Along with all the other tasks, documentation of all new and existing features will be done and displayed to kapitan.dev and walkthroughs will be made for the examples given in the documentation.</p>\n",
