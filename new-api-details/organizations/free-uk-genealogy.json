These books record the date and location of people's deaths, their occupations, and often the same information about the family members that executed the wills.</p>\n<p>In previous projects, all this material was transcribed manually by volunteers, as the source documents were handwritten. The probate books are different, however, in that they are printed and thus are accessible to OCR. We should be able to use OCR text to seed a database by parsing the text for names, dates, occupations, and relationships. We should also be able to use OCR bounding box coordinates to associate regions of a scanned page with an entry for presentation to researchers or for correction by volunteers.</p>\n",

For an example, when we state about a marriage, we have to show how we got hold of that information. Most probably the marriage may be recorded in a handwritten register and later it was included into a book. When citing we have to include both the hand written register and the book. This leads the readers to the original source of information. But the citations used here are slightly different from the citations used in academia. The aim of this project is to add a interface where the users can easily generate those citations.</p>\n",
