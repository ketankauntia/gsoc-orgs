There are subjective tasks at times, which might not have a clear answer associated with them\n3. The size of the dataset might be huge enough for a few people to annotate\n\nTo resolve this, a solution is to let multiple people annotate the data and then aggregate the annotations based on a consensus. Crowdsourcing has become an essential paradigm for efficiently labelling large datasets, especially in the era of data-driven ML solutions. However, the challenge arises in aggregating the labels from a diverse pool of annotators, each with varying reliability.\nThis project aims to develop solutions to handle the above problems and integrate their solution into CVAT.
