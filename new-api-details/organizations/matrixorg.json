Discoverability is currently another issue, Riot is a completely frontend application so spidering it is near-impossible, this can be solved through making a read-only server generated view for spiders to work on. Time permitted I will also touch on making a slightly more involved bridging library and look forward until federation stabilises so that I can make an S-S bridge (no HS needed)</p>\n",

On desktop, this situation prevents writing clients, bots and bridges that can interact with encrypted rooms in any other language than javascript. Tackling this issue would benefit the matrix ecosystem by seeing more featureful projects emerge in a variety of languages (Python in this case). It also supports the Matrix long-term goal of having E2E encryption turned on by default in private rooms.</p>\n",

This will allow easier debugging and enable more people to review pull requests in the code-gen heavy crates. I plan to implement macro testing using <a href=\"https://github.com/dtolnay/trybuild\" target=\"_blank\">trybuild</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/eupn/macrotest\" target=\"_blank\">macrotest</a> for both <code>ruma-events</code> and <code>ruma-api</code>. I will improve the error messages of the <code>proc_macro</code>s in <code>ruma-api</code> and <code>ruma-events</code> by using relevant spans and crafting helpful suggestions or examples to emit to the compiler, so the user knows exactly where and how to fix their code.</p>\n<p>The other goal of the project is to implement new code generation macros for the next breaking release version of <code>ruma-events</code>. The release will contain a major rewrite of how the event types are structured themselves and within collections. I will work on generating code for the new collection types and adapt existing code generation to the new API.</p>\n",

As of now in matrix spec, one of the methods of doing device verification is by doing SAS verification, which will be a major focus area of the project. The next scope that needs to be implemented is the cross signing feature. This feature enables the user to use multiple devices simultaneously to communicate.

A user can either be invited, kicked or put in a “standby” state for a room based on their past interactions.\n\nThere are five main components in this project:\n1) A reusable frontend component that handles the login UI for both Matrix and other third-party services.\n2) A server-side component and a bot that verifies a user’s authorization to a room and decides their membership.\n3) An admin panel to configure the relationship between matrix rooms and groups in third party services.\n4) An external invite URL that can be used to get an invite to a room.\n5) Token authenticated account registration for existing authorized users.\n\nI will be using the matrix-nio library mainly for building the bot since it has most of the functions required for interacting with the server and building a feature-rich tool.",
