They split the input into chunks, and calculate the hash of each chunk using a simple (i.e. fast) hashing algorithm. What is important to note here is that the hash for the whole string is calculated incrementally, beginning from zero (or some known constant value), and for each chunk the checksum of the string including that chunk is calculated only using the old checksum (of the string without the new chunk) and the difference between the last chunk and the current one.</p>\n<p>Some useful rolling hash algorithms that could be employed are Fletcher’s checksum algorithms or the Adler-32 checksum.</p>\n",

However, to allow for a large variety of endpoint types to integrate with Ceph, we are encountered with some inconvenience on these various protocols from different service infrastructure. The workaround for the notification brings the burden of adaptor deployment, communication and translation overhead.AMQP 1.0 is the latest standard for AMQP. It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale, and it contains less explicit routing than previous versions. Even though Ceph has supported the AMQP(ver 0.9.1) natively, the gap between these two protocol specifications cannot be ignored. The next level AMQP(ver 1.0) requires a completely different client library.  AMQP 1.0 brokers are supported by Apache Qpid/ActiveMQ project and Azure platform, etc. To address this problem, we should support the AMQP 1.0 natively in the Ceph Rados Gateway. This requires adding the qpid-proton client library to the Rados Gateway code base, and use it to send notifications to AMQP 1.0 compatible brokers.</p>\n",

This project aims to improve the dashboard’s usability by refining the notification system and adding a structured workflow for managing NVMe-oF devices. These enhancements will simplify monitoring and device management, making Ceph more user-friendly and efficient.\n\nDeliverables\nBy the end of the project, the following deliverables will be completed:\n\nEnhanced Notification System\n\nImprove the notification framework to ensure better alert visibility and management.\n\nImplement customization options for filtering, grouping, and prioritizing notifications.\n\nEnsure seamless backend integration and optimized frontend display.\n\nNVMe-oF Device Management Workflow\n\nDesign and develop a user-friendly interface for managing NVMe-oF devices.\n\nImplement backend logic to support NVMe-oF device operations within the Ceph Dashboard.\n\nEnsure proper testing and documentation for maintainability.\n\nFirst Two Weeks Plan\nDuring the initial two weeks, the focus will be on:\n\nWeek 1: Reviewing the existing notification system, identifying pain points, and drafting an improvement plan. Conducting discussions with the community to gather feedback and finalize design considerations.\n\nWeek 2: Researching NVMe-oF integration requirements, setting up development environments, and drafting an initial workflow design.\n\nThese structured improvements will enhance Ceph Dashboard’s usability and provide a smoother user experience for storage administrators.",

          "description": "smartmontools (smartctl) is a widely used tool for collecting SMART metrics from storage devices (SATA, SAS, NVMe). However, its runtime metadata file, drivedb.h, suffers from inconsistent labeling of attributes such as SSD wear level, which hinders meaningful data analysis and monitoring. These inconsistencies make it challenging to integrate smartctl metrics into observability tools used in Ceph and other environments.\n\nThis project proposes a two-part solution. First, I will add an interpretation primitive in smartmontools’ C++ codebase to handle transformations such as converting wear remaining to wear used (e.g., 100 - value). Second, I will develop a regex-based postprocessor tool to normalize and map freeform SMART attribute labels from drivedb.h to a consistent and defined set. This tool will help standardize outputs and facilitate reliable data ingestion for observability dashboards.\n\nDeliverables include:\n\nInterpretation logic enhancement in the smartmontools C++ source\n\nA standalone normalization tool (in Python, Go, or C++)\n\nDocumentation and guidelines for community usage and extension\n\nOptional test suite to validate attribute normalization",
