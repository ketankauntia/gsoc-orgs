This project would aim to do the DOCX import part of it.</p>\n<p>The problem with the current import is that table styles found in DOCX documents are converted into direct formatting at the level of Writer core. This temporarly solution works fine until someone wants to edit the table, which can cause loss of formatting now. Furthermore, doing this conversion upon opening a DOCX document is very slow.</p>\n<p>The aim of my project would be implementing the DOCX import of table styles and removing the current style-based formatting conversion to direct formatting.

While .svgz is an option in the save dialog, it is incorrectly implemented (no compression actually happens, it's just an svg with a different extension).\n\nThe plan is to create a new and extensible way that uncompresses the file buffer after determining if its compressed from its header,and try to open the uncompressed file buffer.\n\nThe plan for the second goal would be to find a way to determine whether the file we're saving needs to be compressed (either by checking the extension or by creating a new option in the file saving dialog) and compress the file buffer before saving. This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example.\n\nDeliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",

A lot of unit tests are run in Jenkins when contributers submit their patches to gerrit. It usually takes hours to run all the tests across different platforms, especially in rush hours. Therefore, a better test selection method is needed to reduce the load in testing while maintaining a high software quality.\n\nRecently, machine learning is used to predict whether a patch can pass a given test. This can greatly reduce the testing load because we can skip the tests that is very likely to pass when a patch is submitted. Although feature engineering isn't trivial, transformers have been proved useful in feature extraction under similar problem settings. Therefore, I propose that we can implement a machine learning based test selection method to select tests to run in the CI chain to reduce testing load.",

As currently implemented the Report Builder uses a combination of Java and the Pentaho Report Designer library which makes maintaining its code more difficult and creates issues for packaging LibreOffice in different distributions. This project aims to solve these issues by implementing Report Builder in C++ and removing the Java and Pentaho dependencies from the LibreOffice code base.",

This project suggests developing a new tool named pythonmaker using C++ in LibreOffice's codemaker framework to create Python stub files (.pyi) based on UNO's IDL definitions. Such stubs will contain correct type hints according to PEP 484/561 guidelines so that features such as autocompletion, static analysis, and improved navigation can be provided in Python IDEs.\n\npythonmaker will make use of existing infrastructure such as codemaker::TypeManager and convert UNO interfaces, structs, enums, and constants into their Python counterparts. The output files will be structured by UNO namespaces, e.g., com/sun/star/. The project also features comprehensive testing—using CppUnit, MyPy, Pyright, and actual IDE validation—to provide quality and usability. Overall, this will dramatically enhance the Python development experience within LibreOffice.",

The new system will decouple the shape data model from its rendering instructions, ensuring resolution independence and easier integration with alternative renderers. The work involves analyzing the existing code, developing a conversion layer to map high-level shape abstractions to lightweight geometric primitives, refactoring core shape and view components, and validating the changes through unit tests and performance benchmarks. Deliverables include fully refactored code, a robust conversion module, updated rendering components and comprehensive unit tests.",
