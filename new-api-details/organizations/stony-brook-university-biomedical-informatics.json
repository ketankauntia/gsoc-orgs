So far, I have developed a standalone application importing and visualizing the high-resolution large images utilizing PyQt and openslide-python. The interactive front panel is shown in the following Additional Info URL. The image region being visualized is defined by multiple parameters by users. This summer, I will implement scripted modules (Python) incorporating functionalities of Openslide, VTK, Qt, Slice libraries and Medical Reality Markup Language (MRML) to do streaming I/O and sub-region based processing of the images.</p>\n",
