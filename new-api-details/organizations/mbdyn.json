          "description": "The MBDyn Python Preprocessor simplifies the creation of input files for MBDyn simulations by bridging Python programming with MBDyn's input format. This project enhances the simulation workflow through two key improvements. The first transforms the YAML-based Rotorcraft Parametric Modeling tool into Python classes within the preprocessor, creating an object-oriented framework for rotorcraft modeling. The second integrates the preprocessor with Blendyn (a Blender add-on), enabling users to create, edit, simulate and visualize MBDyn models entirely within Blender. These enhancements make MBDyn modeling more intuitive and accessible while providing a seamless workflow for both pre- and post-processing tasks.",
