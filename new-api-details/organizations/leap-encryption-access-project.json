Implementation of the project is intended to be done following a Test-Driven Development model, in order to ensure a higher test coverage and to be able to perform implementation and testing sub-tasks in parallel. Proper documentation will allow the project to be maintained easily. I am also interested in mentoring for this organization in future GSoC projects (if I am lucky enough to be chosen to help them develop the password keeper) given my personal interests in the projects they lead.</p>\n",

          "description": "Being a privacy enthusiast and an end user, the idea proposed by LEAP group for implementing Client-side Tracking-, Malware and Ad-Blocker really caught my attention. \n\nIn this digital era, most important thing  whenever surfing the internet; is protecting yourself and your loved ones from the malwares, trackers and adwares. Implementing features like filtering DNS requests and blocking the particulars would help in maintaining privacy and protection. \nIn this project, I would be working on the client-side approach for creating the blocker. The blocker would work across different platforms including- Desktop, Android, Linux and Mac. For developing the UI Components of the blocker, I will go with QT5 as the LEAP projects use the same. And for the Android implementation, I will be using Java and Android-specific XML.\n\nFirstly, in the main desktop client- the features of blockers would be included in the settings menu along with a simple feature switch. Pre-configured blocking lists would be shipped with each release. This would help us in filtering out the DNS requests and blocking the IPs in our target blocking list.\nI will package the entire solution in a self-contained Go Library that will be able to read packages from a given file descriptor and work accordingly.\n\nFuture Scope includes implementation in iOS environment and  implementing update mechanism.",
