Currently in PCL, this has been done by providing separate classes/functions having independent APIs.</p>\n<p>With the integration of execution policies and executors (part of C++23 hopefully) libraries like PCL will be able to provide a unified API to switch between different implementations. To ensure there is no sudden breakage in the existing API, a transition phase is needed to slowly phase out the old API in favour of a unified API.</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>This project aims to transition the existing API to forward-compatible unified API. \nThe basic details are:\nUsing tag dispatching to enable function overloading, allowing user to select  between different available implementations.\nLack of tags allows PCL to choose best possible implementations, this allows to maintain backward compatibility with current API.\nMissing implementation for a tag raises compile-time errors\nProviding SIMD/OpenMP/CUDA implementations of existing algorithms using the proposed unified API.</p>\n",

Further enhancements to the filters, such as parallelizing loops, are challenging due to the necessary boilerplate code requiring changes to all the equivalent code across multiple classes without breaking them.</p>\n<p>We found some instances of the boilerplate codes in the voxel filters: <code>ApproximateVoxelGrid</code>, <code>VoxelGrid</code>, <code>GridMinimum</code>, <code>VoxelGridLabel</code>, <code>UniformSampling</code> (and also in the binary removal filters)</p>\n<p>Our goal was to investigate a unified code design that eliminates redundancy by refactoring similar code pieces across multiple filters without breaking the present API, while simultaneously attempting to simplify implementation and increase runtime speed.</p>\n",
