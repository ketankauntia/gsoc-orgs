Moreover, additional branches of the master file are generated upon storing a diff in order to ensure the compatibility of future changes of the base examples with the HOWTOs.

According to my understanding, the main change from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x is migrating from the static graph as default to the dynamic graph as default. Since using the static graph leads to lots of indirection between the code we write and the code we run, it is actually difficult to debug. However, using a dynamic graph, the code we wrote is the code we run, this helps us with debugging, profiling, etc. Thus I am very excited about contributing the migration to TensorFlow 2.x.</p>\n",

At CVPR 2019, three dif- ferent solutions using this 3D representation were proposed (Occupancy Networks, DeepSDF, and IM-NET), and they show that this representation is better in some as- pects(e.g., accuracy, memory efficiency) than voxel grids or meshes, which are usually used in previous studies.\nNowadays, there are two major deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and Py- Torch. Each of them has some libraries such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which help users to use 3D models in neural networks easily. Unfortunately, none of the three works mentioned above are implemented in TensorFlow Graphics, whereas Kaolin provides their code. This is not a good situation for TensorFlow users who want to try using \"implicit 3D representations\" in their experiments or projects.\nIn this proposal, I propose a project to implement these three works in Tensorflow Graphics. I will also work on equipping some 3D geometry utilities to support users to handle the three baselines on the same interface.</p>\n",

This consists of my contribution to the architecture and implementation of these models.</li>\n<li>Proposing models to add: I am making sure I keep my innovative side in this program by trying to suggest ideas of models that can be added to TF Hub.  For instance, there are few models that treat underrepresented languages in NLP, like Arabic. My contribution to this can be crucial as I have experience dealing with these types of models and am aware of the difficulties someone can encounter when dealing with this.

The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. Keeping this in mind, this project attempts to develop a sophisticated diagnosing technique that will highlight the potential cancerous regions in a given ‘Prostate biopsy slide’, thereby aiding the doctors in faster and more accurate diagnosis. However, in the presence of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) (doctors, radiologists, etc.…) this task becomes trivial, but in the absence of SMEs diagnosing PCa via 'Whole Slide Images' is almost always impossible. In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is drastically underfunded and the vast majority of these countries cannot provide basic healthcare to the public. In such conditions, the availability of doctors is very unlikely. Automated analysis and classification of biopsy images without the presence of any subject matter expert is a crucial task. Thus, developing a reliable and robust system, susceptible to noise, in the form of a web app or inference engine is the project's main goal.",

          "description": "I will potentially work towards the following problems during the GSoC:\n\n1)  I am excited to implement advanced algorithms in JAX and create/re-produce demos/figures to put in textbooks. For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as  lax.scan() to optimize the training loop.\n\n2)  I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book.  For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. \n\n3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9  shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",

          "description": "KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. \n\nFirstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be \"in graph mode\". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT.\n\nSecondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling.\n\nI also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build \"building blocks\" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks.\n\n\nText augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement.\n\nThe above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",

Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases.\nThrough my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \\\nThe 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation\nAll of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list.\nBy the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",

          "description": "This project outlines the development of a Flutter plugin for MediaPipe, with a focus on a feature-first approach. The plan includes implementing the Text Task API, Audio Task API, and Vision Task API, which covers Hand Landmark Detection, Gesture Recognition, and Image Classification and Embedding. The project also involves testing and documenting each feature, as well as creating demo apps to showcase them. The project is estimated to take approximately 12 weeks, with each feature being developed and tested in a separate 1-3 week timeframe. The final week will be dedicated to finalizing documentation, creating code tutorials, and preparing the plugin for publication. The goal is to create a high-quality, well-documented plugin that is compatible with different platforms and easy to use for developers.\r\n\r\nThe main goals for the finished result of the project are:\r\n\r\n- Multi-platform Flutter plugin for MediaPipe - The primary deliverable of the project is a Flutter plugin that is compatible with both iOS and Android.\r\n\r\n- Testing and documentation - Each feature must be thoroughly tested and documented to ensure that they work as intended and that developers can easily use them.\r\n\r\n- Demo apps - Creating demo apps to showcase each feature is an essential part of the project.\r\n\r\n- Interactive Codelab tutorials - While not required, the creation of interactive Codelab tutorials would be a valuable addition to the project, particularly for the documentation phase.",
