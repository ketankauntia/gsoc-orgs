Clearly, there is a big demand for this extension.</p>\n<p>My goal will be creating an advertisement management extension that allows admins to add HTML/JS advertisement code to number of locations in the template. If time allows, many additional features will be implemented, i.e. end date, hide ad for specific groups, adblocker friendly message, ad priority, views and clicks counting, ad owners, banner uploads, extensible and/or additional template locations and PHP event hooks for other extensions to further enhance usage experience.</p>\n",
