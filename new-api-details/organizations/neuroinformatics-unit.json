          "description": "Synopsis:\n\nThis project aims to enhance the brainglobe-registration tool by automating the selection of atlas regions for aligning 2D or 3D brain images to a standard anatomical reference via brainglobe-atlasapi. Currently, this process is manual, time-consuming, and subjective, posing a barrier to reproducibility and efficiency. By introducing a new preprocessing step that automatically identifies the optimal atlas region – using methods such as adaptive grid search, machine learning, or Bayesian optimisation – this project will streamline the workflow and improve accuracy. Deliverables include at least two implemented approaches, benchmarking, comprehensive testing, full documentation, and a blog post to showcase the new functionality.\n\nThis automation directly benefits my research in paediatric radiotherapy, where mapping histology images to an atlas is essential for analysing cellular behaviour across brain regions. By making this process faster and more robust, it not only enhances my own work but also enables broader adoption of BrainGlobe tools by researchers in neuroscience and healthcare, even those without extensive anatomical expertise.\n\nMinimal Set of Deliverables:\n\n•\tImplement a new preprocessing step to automatically select the atlas region.\n•\tCompare at least two region-selection methods (e.g., adaptive grid search vs ML/Bayesian optimisation).\n•\tAdd tests to validate the new functionality.\n•\tDocument the new pipeline and add usage instructions.\n•\tWrite a blog post showcasing the project and results.",
