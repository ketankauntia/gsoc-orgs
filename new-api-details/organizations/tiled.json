While currently possible in multiple steps, there is no way to do this in just one. A shape fill tool will solve this, and pair nicely with the Wang implementation. Users will be able to pick a shape (rectangle, circle, maybe more) and click and drag to fill an area of that shape with a selected tile stamp, random tiles, or Wang set.</p>\n",
