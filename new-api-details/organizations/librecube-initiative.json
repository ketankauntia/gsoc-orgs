This paper addresses the need for effective space traffic management in an environment where a small number of dominant space situational awareness (SSA) companies overshadow a long tail of competitors, resulting in underutilization of expert insights and missed opportunities for valuable information confrontation. Originating as an initiative under the European Space Agency Tech Innovation, the proposed approach employs business incentives to enhance transparency, predictability, and accountability in line with current and evolving regulations. Leveraging user voting mechanisms, the rules governing applications can evolve dynamically, making it particularly suitable for space traffic management, an arena lacking established global regulations and in urgent need of a coordinated international agreement. Recognizing the orbit as a global commons, effective international negotiation in this context often assumes a business-oriented language. Within the DAO framework, applications serve as global marketplaces for insights, facilitating information exchange for space traffic management, while concurrently functioning as a global market for judgment, where the reliability of participants is evaluated based on their performance.",
