          "description": "Currently, the way to manage (CRUD) Jenkins X resources(pipelines) is by using the cli. While the CLI is very powerful and user friendly, it should be used by power users (release team who installs and manages jenkins x clusters). We should not expect developers who are concerned with only the pipelines to install the cli (This does not scale when you have 100+ developers in the company) We do have a UI/dashboard, but it is read only, so users cannot use it to trigger release pipelines or stop running pipelines. In addition, we do not have an audit trail of who did what. So, we propose a new UI/dashboard which has feature parity with the CLI (including SSO and RBAC) The UI should make the JX cli redundant, and add more value to the user with easily available status and logs of the entire cluster",
