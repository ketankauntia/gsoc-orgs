React has been one of the front-runner frameworks spearheading this more robust front ends rendering SPA frontend dramatically fast.\nThis has been at the cost of getting down a barrage of javascript in the beginning and rendering it on the fly using the browser’s Javascript and rendering engines.  This is counter intuitive to the User Experience goals of a single page application paradigm.</p>\n<p>A trivial solution that comes into mind is to push this workload to the server to process this Logic in the back end and send it to the server. This raises the concerns of the requirement of an Isomorphic JS backend such as NodeJS. However, with a back end that utilize Java 8 which comes packing with a much more advanced Javascript Engine - Nashorn, possibilities crop up.</p>\n<p>The main idea of this project wraps around finding an efficient paradigm to develop SPA’s by pre-rendering partially or whole HTML DOMs in the back end and delegating the basic DOM rendering of the static or partially static contents to the browser.</p>\n",

While development of settings app, maintenance app and app-management app is nearly complete, the User Profile App is yet to get started. As part of the GSOC 2016, I propose to develop user profile application for DHIS2. This app will essentially provide a user interface to DHIS2 users to -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View and edit user profile details.</li>\n<li>View and edit user account settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will be using ReactJS view library and will follow a Flux based architecture to write this app. The application's architecture should be such that we can reuse most of its components in other apps using D2-UI. It is important that the overall look and feel of this app matches that of the other new client-side applications. D2 should be extended by adding methods and properties so that it is capable of performing all operations required to view and update user profile and account settings.</p>\n",
