However, the framework's reliance on standard Python objects to represent agents poses scalability challenges, hindering performance as the number of agents grows. This limitation renders the execution of even modestly sized models, comprising a few thousand agents, impractical. The community has long requested a more performant version of mesa. While a refactor using Cython could address performance issues, it would introduce significant complexity and require users to adapt their methods to Cython, compromising Python's simplicity. The mesa-frames initiative proposes leveraging vectorized operations on dataframes, utilizing libraries such as pandas and polars, to enhance performance and scalability. This approach benefits from the optimized, out-of-the-box operations these libraries provide and their intuitive, well-documented APIs, which simplify custom agent creation.",

The core focus is on developing a flexible framework that allows researchers to analyze simulation data with greater precision and lower overhead. One of the main components, the Stats Collection, will enable users to define exactly which statistics they want to track—such as mean, max, or count—helping reduce both memory usage and computation time.\n\nAnother key feature is the Event Driven Collection, which records data only when predefined conditions are met. This ensures researchers capture meaningful insights while avoiding unnecessary logging and storage. To support even larger simulations, the project will also include integration with external storage systems like PostgreSQL and S3, allowing collected data to be streamed directly to disk or the cloud.\n\nIn addition to these core improvements, the project will focus on performance optimization through lazy execution with Polars and better vectorization. Clear, modular documentation and a focus on usability will ensure Mesa-Frames remains an accessible and powerful tool.",

The project addresses two key issues in the current visualization system: clumped API design and difficulties in model sharing.\n\nThe implementation plan is divided into two phases:\n1) Phase 1 focuses on creating a more modular API for space drawing by developing AgentPortrayalStyle and PropertyLayerStyle components, separating agent drawing from grid drawing with a CoordinateMapper, and creating a unified SpaceRenderer class.\n2) Phase 2 implements model sharing through links, upgrades the Altair visualization backend to match matplotlib capabilities and improves documentation.\n\nDeliverables include: a separate and intuitive visualization API, easy model sharing functionality, an improved Altair backend and comprehensive documentation. This upgrade will significantly improve the user experience for Mesa users.",
