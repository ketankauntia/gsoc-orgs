A supervisor will be able to review the forms and upload the good ones and send back the bad ones for improvement. So this project will allow enumerators to share partially/completely filled forms with each other and also help supervisor in reviewing the forms. The main focus of this project is to see the pros/cons of different communication strategies possible in Android devices and select the one which is both robust and reliable.</p>\n",
