These features and extensibility have made Inkscape the wonderful software it is today.\nBut, these features come with a cost, i.e. difficulty accessing these features. Currently, operations have to be searched through highly nested and huge drop-downs. Also, you have to remember where the option was. Keyboard shortcuts don't solve the problem due to their learning curve, system shortcuts, and the limit on the number of keys that can humanly be pressed.\nCommand Palette(CP) is an interactive search bar that can search any operation (extensions, edits, filters, etc.) that Inkscape provides. CP is also a tool for the <strong>power users</strong> It speeds up the access times by using commands that help users to bypass the slow GUI and use mostly their speedy keyboards.\nAnother problem is repetition. The ordered nature of most drawings calls for repetition. As we know Inkscape is a tool for creative people and nothing kills creativity faster than repetition. \nMacros are a way to record your actions and repeat them.
