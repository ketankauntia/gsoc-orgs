To support the release of newest edition of AIMA, some of the original Python instances need to be altered to fit the changes in book. Currently the repo 'aima-Python' records all the algorithms in the 3rd edition but not updated for the 4th yet. What needs to be done is to check differences between the third edition and fourth edition pseudocode, provide python examples, test cases, demos and documents for the altered parts. If possible, some visualization methods such as animation will make the algorithms clearer.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Currently, this project is targeted towards the fourth edition of the book. There are plenty of APIs which are yet to be implemented in the AIMA4e branch. To be precise, the Problem Solving section is already been implemented. Though there are subtle changes and minor additions which are yet to be done in this section. The \"Knowledge, reasoning and planning\" section and “Uncertain knowledge and Reasoning” section was partially implemented last year. Implementation of the “Learning” section is not initialized yet. Therefore, as a part of my GSoC proposal, I plan to implement the <strong>Learning</strong> section of the textbook. Depending on the advice from the mentor, I would also be interested in making APIs for the <strong>Knowledge, reasoning and planning</strong> and <strong>Uncertain knowledge and reasoning</strong> sections of the textbook for AIMA4e branch. I also plan to add the explanatory notebooks for these sections. I’ve already worked on some notebooks before, hence would love to contribute to the same.</p>\n<p>Besides this, I  plan to write the tests for updated algorithms of the fourth edition and demonstrate these on the various problems as done in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e/aima-gui/src/main/java/aima/gui/demo\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> package of aima3e branch.</p>\n",
