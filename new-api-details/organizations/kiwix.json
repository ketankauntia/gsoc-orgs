The problem with vue.js is that it needs a special effort to keep the visual coherence with the rest of the app in Qt.\nThe filters panel in the library also suffers from being outdated.

Therefore, the easiest it is to generate content that is available offline, the more users can be reached.\n\nNautilus is a powerful tool for creating ZIM files from collections of documents (PDF files, videos, etc.), but it currently requires the user to run commands from the command line. This makes it challenging for users (usually schools) who are not familiar with the command line or who prefer a graphical user interface.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a web-based user interface for Nautilus, making it easier for users to convert their collections of documents into browsable ZIM files. The web UI will be built using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for Nautilus.",

A scheduling mechanism will run in the backend, checking for due tasks, queuing ZIM generation jobs in zimfarm, sending notifications, and cleaning up old files to manage storage.\n\nKey components (deliverables):\n\n - A Vue.js UI for configuring schedules, viewing status, and managing tasks.\nFlask-based REST API endpoints for handling schedule data and triggering generation.\n - A scheduler to automate task execution.\n - Email notifications and cleanup logic for outdated ZIMs.\n - Full test coverage and documentation for both users and developers.",
