Think of it as Google: after processing the input keywords (e.g. ignoring stop words and applying different kinds of normalization), Hibernate Search returns results ordered by relevance. It brings significant benefits comparing to normal SQL for search-related uses cases.

It has already developed good logical structures for sending of push notifications using JMS. Moreover,  its \"sender\" module is mainly constructed of different message queues and their producers and consumers. On the other hand, the server DB is currently based on MySQL/PostgreSQL and each data entry lies in one DB scheme.\n   We need the process for sending of push notifications and the evaluation of message metrics to be as fast as possible and as scalable as possible. Therefore, with an increase of our data problems can be caused by slow writes/reads to DB and not scalable enough message queue usage.\n    The idea of the project is to try to overcome these obstacles and rebuild some modules of the system in the way that they perform well even if the data volume they are operating over increases. For that two different approaches can be taken. To speed up the DB access a new distributed, scalable, big data store HBase can be integrated into the project. For more scalable processing of the data, Apache Kafka can be used instead of JMS.</p>\n",

However, when this system is put under pressure with a high level of users and an intense quantity of push metrics it is unable to perform optimally. The reality here could be a poor user experience with slow message delivery, dropped messages or the possibility of service unavailability. As messages begin to exceed millions, this will become a bottleneck for the system and one which needs to be addressed and engineered with scalability in mind.</p>\n<p>This project will investigate the possibilities of using different types of databases and methods to process large volumes of data. This will be a Proof of Concept that will aim to research Apache Kafka and Apache HBase as possible solutions to improve the real-time experience of the push metric of the AeroGear Unified Push Server.</p>\n",

While developing Elytron the idea was to provide a better and stronger authentication and build something that does more than just unifying the security solution. Intrusion Detection using Elytron is aimed at doing the same i.e. to extend Elytron’s functionality. \nIntrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely to occur.  The purpose of this project is to implement an Intrusion Detection system that detects suspicious activity or a potential attack and report it to the administrator.</p>\n",

Then studying and comparing the existing Quarkus Maven plugin source code and Quarkus Gradle plugin source code we realize where Quarkus lags behind in the case of Gradle.

These plugins can then be embedded into any host CLI with additional features such as new version detection and smooth upgrades.Through Charmil, each CLI will be able to install other CLIs as extensions, thereby organizing them in a hierarchy.

The target benchmark to beat would be “1 auth and rep (using authrep.xml endpoint)” per request. The filter will be written in Rust and then later “translated” into WASM code packaged as WASM Module which is loaded on WASM VMs spun up by a runtime (V8, WAVM, or Wasmtime) embedded inside the Envoy. Many advantages come with using the WASM module instead of the native C++ extension like dynamically loading the filter extension, abstraction from the underlying CPU and programming language used, and being safe from crashing the proxy when a developer makes a mistake. Even though the module is sandboxed, it has the capability for I/O as described in the ABI Specification which empowers us with access to shared data storage (key-value based) and a message queue used in this project.</p>\n",

It uses Hyper Parameter Optimization to tune the language runtime layers of a given application.\nSystem component metrics can give a better look into what is happening inside them. Metrics are particularly useful for building dashboards and alerts.\nKubernetes components emit metrics in Prometheus format. This format is structured plain text, designed so that people and machines can both read it.Following are four common methods of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning in order of increasing efficiency:\n1.Manual\n2.Grid search\n3.Random search\n4.Bayesian model-based optimization\n\nThe aim of Bayesian reasoning is to become “less wrong” with more data which these approaches do by continually updating the surrogate probability model after each evaluation of the objective function.\nAt a high-level, Bayesian optimization methods are efficient because they choose the next hyperparameters in an informed manner. The basic idea is: spend a little more time selecting the next hyperparameters in order to make fewer calls to the objective function. In practice, the time spent selecting the next hyperparameters is inconsequential compared to the time spent in the objective function. By evaluating hyperparameters that appear more promising from past results, Bayesian methods can find better model settings than random search in fewer iterations.So,this project aims at tuning kubernetes applications using bayesian optimization.",

It’s an innovative tool because it’s creating the test once and testing with any version of the tested software. EAT is available for a number of server configurations and a CI pipeline can be built using the maven tool. The goal of the present project is to extend EAT with new features and tools. The implementation of the project is estimated to last from June to November (Large Size Project) and the timeline is envisaged as follows: During the 1st Phase (June 2022 - July 2022) a snapshot will be added for testing the latest version of JBoss Community Server. The newly added snapshot will be made available for use with the CI builds. Moreover, the extension of EAT with additional multiversion android projects (described at the second phase) will begin. Continuing to the 2nd Phase (July 2022 - September 2022), new multiversion Android projects will be added to EAT. In EAT there is already a basic android  multiversion example. This will be extended with other open source android projects demonstrating how EAT can be used to support multiversion real life android projects. Finally, during the 3rd Phase ( September 2022 – November 2022) a multi-version Android application will be developed and added to EAT. This app will enable users to upload  and view descriptions and ways of usage for various programs or functions.  The users will be able to upload the descriptions of projects related to EAT, how they can be used and other project related information. The documents will be proposed for acceptance and when accepted they will be stored in  e.g. google drive, from where they will be accessible for anyone interested.",
