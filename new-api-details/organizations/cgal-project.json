But hex-meshing is a hard problem and is often done by parameterizing tetrahedral meshes and extracting hexahedral meshes using certain heuristic rules. Numerical inconsistencies and extraction of non-hexahedral polytopes can be avoided at the extraction stage.\nThe algorithm to be implemented is delineated in the paper by Lyon et al: HexEx: Robust Hexahedral Mesh Extraction. My work is to incorporate the algorithm to create hexahedral meshes using combinatorial maps package in CGAL.</p>\n<p>CGAL has a generalized maps package, which generalizes representation of any oriented object of n-dimensions with n-dimensional subdivisions, each of which is stored as a set of darts and pointers that point to other darts, which could be thought of as an oriented edge or 1-cell. We use this data structure to hold the hexahedral subdivisions of the 3D object. The package has classes to define implementations of darts, cells, generalized maps, which will be used for the implementation.</p>\n",

(2013). The existing implementation isotropically remshes surfaces in three steps: first, edge splitting or collapsing depending on their \nlength relative to the target edge length; second, edge flipping to improve vertex valence; third, tangential relaxation to improve the vertex distribution. The planned extension with the adaptive remeshing involves expanding the edge splitting and collapsing rules, and introducing a new formulation of the tangential relaxation; in addition, feature edges must be addressed. Apart from implementing those three necessary functionalities in CGAL, the contribution to the project would include creating tests, examples, and documentation.",

This allows for several undesirable configurations, such as self-intersecting rings, badly nested rings (inner outside outer), and inner rings that split the interior of the polygon into multiple disjoint parts. Such undesirable configurations are considered as invalid polygons in many applications, such as in Geographic Information Systems through ISO 19107.\n\nThe aim of this project is to incorporate the polygon repair method originally described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009 (but later improved) as a CGAL package. This method consists of three steps: (1) a constrained triangulation of the polygon, (2) labelling of its faces as interior/exterior, (3) extraction of the resulting polygon(s) from the sets of labelled triangular faces.\n\nThe method is already implemented using CGAL and freely available as prepair: https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair. Integrating it with CGAL as a new package would likely involve switching the code's GDAL dependency with new functions for native CGAL types, adding some functionality in the CGAL 2D/3D Triangulations package (proper deletion of constraints), and the writing of CGAL-style templated code (with support for different kernels and so on).",

          "description": "The goal of this project is to enhance the existing Dual Contouring (DC) method in CGAL by implementing manifold contouring methods. While the classical DC is a powerful isosurfacing method, it may produce non-nonmanifold surfaces, leading to topological inconsistencies and computational challenges. Manifold dual contouring methods overcome this issue by introducing manifold constraints to ensure the generation of 2-manifold surfaces.\n\nThe project will begin with a detailed study of existing literature, including Manifold Dual Contouring by Schaefer, Ju and Warren, and other related methods. Based on the research, we will determine an algorithm that combines the most robust aspects of these methods. The next phase is to review current DC implementations in CGAL  to identify gaps that require modifications, particularly in routines such as the Quadratic Error Function (QEF) minimization, octree traversal, and polygonalization. Lastly, additional features will be added, including manifold criterions like the Euler characteristic test, and the support for multiple vertices per cell.\n\nThe final deliverables will be a robust implementation of the enhanced DC method integrated into CGAL under the Isosurfacing subroutine. The implementation will adhere to CGAL’s existing coding conventions to ensure flexibility, consistency, and maintainability within the library. The documentation will include a test file under Isosurfacing 3/test/Isosurfacing 3, visualization of test cases under Isosurfacing/fig, and a theoretical background under Isosurfacing 3/doc/Isosurfacing 3/Isosurfacing 3.txt.",
