The project also requires implementing code classifier which will  allow creators to train a classifier for code interaction input. This will allow Oppia to give feedback more efficiently whenever an input fails to classify in any of the hard rules specified by creator, rather than giving default outcome feedback.</p>\n<p>Basically there are 3 things to do in this project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create necessary infrastructure for training of machine learning algorithms.</li>\n<li>Implement the code classifier algorithm.</li>\n<li>Enable the machine learning facility in Oppia so that creator can use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The infrastructure to be used by Oppia for training of algorithm is called Oppia-ml. It provides Machine learning - as - a - service infrastructure for Oppia. Moreover prediction should be done in the frontend, in users computer so that there is no need of internet connection for giving feedback to the user. The outcome of this project is complete integration of machine learning framework and make it available to end user in production environment.</p>\n",

In addition, learners can also create their own curated list of explorations and collections which they may want to play later.</p>\n<p>The learner dashboard will help provide an enriching learning experience and will bridge the gap between learners and creators. It'll be at the heart of the learning process and help the learner learn faster. In addition, this project will create the foundation for implementing a rich set of features like recommending the right next courses for individual learners and many other such exciting possibilities. This project, I believe, would mark a major milestone in accomplishing Oppia's mission - 'to help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way'.</p>\n",

The reason these two projects are linked is because one prerequisite for a safe migration is to have full test coverage, so it's important to make sure that the backend coverage is 100% before migrating.The project would  then make sure that all libraries Oppia uses are compatible with python 3. This project would also standardize all scripts in the codebase to be written in Python (currently, there is a mixture of bash and Python being used). The project would end with creating a small list of remaining steps that need to be taken for a final migration to python 3 (once a solution is found for the GAE dependency issues).</p>\n",

This means that variable assignment, procedure parameters, and function return values will all be clearly connected with a type. Strict is a typescript compiler option that enables a set of tougher type rules that, when enabled, assist lower the possibilities of producing surprising outcomes and make the code more resilient, but Oppia's code base presently fails to pass these stringent requirements. As a result, the code is vulnerable to unexpected actions and failures. To avoid this, modify the strict TypeScript config file such that all newly-added files must be strictly typed, and Introduce strict typing for about 280 twins of files, as well as tests for those files (for a total of 560 files), and ensure that no more unknown type is used, as well as removing all unknown type usage from the newly strictly typed files.

This will entail addressing difficulties with heading-related issues, focus management, colour contrast, and more. Many of these a11y issues have contributors associated to them. While I resolve the unassigned problems, I will be available to help any contributors who get stuck or require further support.\n\n\nSecond, I'll utilise Lighthouse to evaluate every Oppia page that is intended for students, raising their accessibility scores to a perfect 100. Each learner-facing page's Lighthouse test audits will need to be examined in order to make the necessary changes. This will include adding alternative text for images, making sure header tags have the right semantic structure, and making sure aria-roles are contained by the appropriate parent.\n\nAlso, in order to aid contributors in understanding the Lighthouse audit procedure and troubleshooting any potential problems that may emerge throughout testing, I will be adding guidance on how to debug Lighthouse tests to the Oppia documentation.",

This project adds the ability to update translations for existing languages in a convenient manner, when changes are made to a lesson.\n\nAlso currently, Oppia faces issues with feedback for learners being missing in lessons, even in cases where it's known that something is likely to result in a misconception and the learner will be needing specific feedback. This project extends current functionality in order to display a list of misconceptions to the lesson creator and providing the ability to tag answer-feedback groups with said misconceptions, so that the lesson creators can accurately provide feedback to learners.",

          "description": "In order to streamline releases, we are planning to ensure that all critical user journeys (CUJs) on the Oppia web application are covered by acceptance tests. This is important because it will provide assurance that, on the merge of every PR, these critical user journeys still function correctly, which means that no major breakages will result if the develop branch gets deployed to production. Additionally, having a complete set of acceptance tests that are organized by CUJ makes it easier to audit whether or not a particular CUJ has been included, and it also helps developers add tests for new CUJs while still keeping the tests well-organized.\n\nThis project includes:\n\nWriting acceptance tests for the as-yet-uncovered CUJs in a way that keeps the tests organized and maintainable. This might also include small updates to the acceptance test framework, e.g. extracting utility functions to enable code reuse or providing relevant functionality for a group of tests.\nTightening all page utility functions to have pre/post checks (in the form of \"wait\" statements) and proper error messaging, so that it is easier to debug flakes. The pre-check wait ensures that the conditions are good for performing the action, and the post-check wait ensures that the action has fully completed.\nDeleting e2e tests whose functionality has been fully replaced by the acceptance tests.",

Currently, Android Lint is not integrated into Oppia's Bazel-based build system. This project aims to bridge that gap by introducing a custom linting script that runs Android Lint independently of Gradle, with support for configurable exemptions via textproto files—ensuring alignment with Oppia’s existing scripting infrastructure.\n\nThe project will proceed in two phases. The first will establish a foundational script that interfaces with Android Lint, handles exemption logic, and integrates with continuous integration workflows. The second will focus on resolving high-priority lint issues to improve overall code quality.\n\nThe completed project will deliver a scalable and maintainable Android linting workflow tailored to the Bazel environment, enhancing code quality and developer productivity across the Oppia Android codebase.",
