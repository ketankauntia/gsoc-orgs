          "description": "<p>The ardupilot features are already numerous and I already worked on helping ardupilot to have good compatibility with ROS.  Ardupilot rover version (APMRover2) is well behind Arduplane and ArduCopter in capabilities as they attract more attention from developers.  One obvious example is that Rover has only a very basic avoidance system (turn 45° on obstacle). It is also missing some autonomous features (on spot turn etc.), and more significantly is missing a proper motor configuration abstraction layer. While ArduCopter is capable of being configured in 4,6,8 motors copter with brushed (PWM) or brushless motor (RC PWM), the rover version is still limited to two modes: rover with propulsion and a steering servo (normal mode) and tank mode (skid steering mode), with only support on brushless motor.\nMy proposal to this GSOC is split in two parts. Firstly, reduce the gap between the APMRover2 and the other vehicles to provide a good generic UGV platform capable of multiple configurations, with advance feature such as avoidance.  Secondly,  provide a good set of tutorials on the usage of ROS and ardupilot either for single unit control or on simulated unit on Gazebo simulator!</p>\n",

This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.</p>\n<p>Situations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously.</p>\n",

Following this, preliminary investigations show that main rotor head momentum is a critical factor.  A methodology is proposed to scale a generic velocity trajectory using the main rotor head momentum in hover.  The trajectory will be empirically determined through SITL and real-life testing.  The resulting flight mode will provide a robust approach to completing an autorotation manoeuvre for any helicopter.

Using Simulink code generation tools to add a custom attitude controller to the ArduPilot will allow the researcher to test their novel control algorithm in ArduPilot without spending too much time in manual coding which will further increase ArduPilot usage in academia. \n\nCurrently, ArduPilot does not have a short and concise way to implement and test custom controllers. This project’s main aim is to create a systematic and sustainable way to implement a custom controller into ArduPilot using Simulink code generation and set an example for other researchers on how to use ArduPilot as a control system development platform. \n\nI implemented a new controller in the ArduCopter and has a Simulink model of this controller, thus I will continue with this vehicle type. But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it. Last, prepare detailed documentation and video to show how to utilize this functionality.",

The core problem is that while camera-based visual odometry can struggle in certain environments and LiDAR systems are often too heavy and expensive for all UAVs, there is not a reliable way for lightweight UAVs to leverage the high-accuracy 3D maps generated by more capable mapping systems.\n\nThe proposed solution is to develop a framework that allows UAVs with 3D cameras to utilize pre-generated, centimeter-level 3D maps for navigation. This will involve a C++ based ROS2 package designed to run on a companion computer. \n\nThis package will:\n\n1. Process the pre-generated maps.\n\n2. Implement point‑cloud matching algorithms (such as ICP and NDT) to align live camera scans with the existing map and compute a 6‑DOF pose.\n\n3. Fuse the estimated pose with IMU data using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide smooth, high‑rate odometry and improve Z‑axis estimation.\n\n4. Incorporate a state machine to manage odometry data, perform sanity checks (e.g. data‑rate drops, connection loss, time desync, corrupted messages), and transmit the validated pose to the UAV’s firmware via MAVLink over serial.\n\nThe key deliverables of this project include:\n\n1. A fully functional prototype in simulation capable of generating maps and producing 6‑DOF estimates with the 3D camera.\n\n2. Algorithm design, implementation, and sensor fusion.\n\n3. System integration, validation, and documentation.\n\n4. A complete hardware setup.",
