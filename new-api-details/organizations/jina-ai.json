It currently supports several deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow. Jax is becoming increasingly popular for deep learning, so we want to integrate it into DocArray.\n\nThe project we propose is to add Jax as a backend for DocArray, alongside PyTorch and TensorFlow. The first part would involve rewriting and translating all of the computational backend functions of DocArray with the Jax framework. Then, we would battle-test the implementation against a real Jax use case, such as integrating DocArray with Jax support for model training and serving.",
