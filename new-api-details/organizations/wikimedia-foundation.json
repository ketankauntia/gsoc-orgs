The aim is to achieve this with the help of algorithms that are specifically designed to flag suspected content, which the editors can then review by a three-way mechanism. The reviewer bot finds articles in given categories, category trees, and lists. For each such article, the bot aims to accomplish the following tasks:\n(1) Flag passages with facts and statistics which are likely to have become out of date and have not been updated in a given number of years\n(2) Flag phrases which are likely unclear\n(3) Flag bad student edits</p>\n<p>Flagged instances are then stored in a database and open to the reviewers for reviewing and closing the flags. A reviewer can decide to either 'Accept' or 'Dismiss' a review item as valid/invalid. Two reviewers decide the fate of each review item, and in the case of a conflict, it is sent to a third reviewer. Reviewer reputation scores are computed based on a mechanism of acceptability of reviews by other peer reviewers. Reviews which lowered the scores can be optionally displayed to the reviewers.</p>\n",

One of it's features is the VueJS based New pages feed which allows patrollers to filter specific interesting pages they might want to patrol based on certain criteria.As part of this project, we would like to enhance the filtering and searching capabilities of the New pages feed. Particularly, we would like to add AI based topic prediction (leveraging the ORES API), the ability to search for a specific keyword in a article, filter by how many pageviews a article gets and be able to search by how similar a particular page is to other deleted pages.
