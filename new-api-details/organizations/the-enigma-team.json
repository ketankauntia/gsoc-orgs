As Tiled offers better room editing features than Game Maker, adding Tiled compatibility to Enigma can help users take advantage of Tiled room editor along with Enigma’s development environment. This project also expects some research to know the intermediate representation of Tiled in much more detail.\nTMX is a Tiled specific room format and EGM is an Enigma specific project format. Most of the features supported by EGM format are based on Game Maker’s format GMX. The way this project aims to achieve Tiled compatibility is twofold. First part consists of adding a TMX importer to Enigma while the second part consists of adding an EGM importer to Tiled. Additional tasks involve analyzing GMX 1.4 to understand various protocol buffer fields, adding Gtests in libEGM to check correctness of deserializer efficiently.",

However, the current implementation is not very clean as it checks the type of each argument against an if-else ladder, making it difficult to read and extend. This project aims to make the serialization framework easier to use and extend by changing the way the serialize, serialize_into and deserialize functions work to dispatch to supported types implicitly without the need for an if-else ladder.\n\nAnd the project also aims to implement support for additional data types like\ngeneric routines for map, vector and complex numbers. This would enable\nmore easily serializing ENIGMA's internal state for use in sending state\neither across a network or into a file.\n\nAdditionally, the project aims to introduce support for the JSON format within the serialization system, offering it as a new option alongside the existing bytes format. This addition enhances the readability and debugging capability of the serialized data.",
