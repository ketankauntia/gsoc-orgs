The application supports various features related to LC-MS,  like raw data import/export, peak-detection, statistical analysis tools and data visualization. The project aims at adding support for mzTab-m file format for MZmine3 which is standard file for result representation of LC-MS data after analysis. Further, CliqueMS feature annotation algorithm will be implemented in Java and associated GUI will be developed in this project.</p>\n",

The calibration will give more accurate and easier to work with data, and is crucial to reduce false positives in molecular identification.</p>\n<p>I am also going to develop deisotoping support using high-resolution of mass spectra. Recent developments allow to obtain mass spectra of resolution high enough to observe differences of nuclear binding energies among isotopes. The new module I am going to build will detect isotopic patterns of chemical compounds and relate fine mass peaks with each other based on m/z differences corresponding to nuclear mass defects of isotopes of selected elements. The project will, among others, help annotate molecular formulas, improve and simplify downstream analysis and also be a software part visualizing the evidence supporting relativity (by incorporating binding energies into molecular prediction).</p>\n",
