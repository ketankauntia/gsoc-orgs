It consists on the GNU Mach microkernel and several user-space servers that offer most of the functions that usually a kernel offers, one of these functions is a TCP/IP stack. Currently, in the Hurd this stack if offered by the pfinet server, a port of the Linux 2.2 TCP/IP stack. This stack should be replaced since it is obsolete and lacks important features like PPP support. In this project, we will port LwIP TCP/IP stack to the Hurd to replace pfinet.</p>\n",
