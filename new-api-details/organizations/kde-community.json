It is a free open-source software able to provide an accurate graphical representation of the night sky, from any location on Earth, at any date and time. Even though KStars is one of the best planetarium software, it currently has a major drawback: it lacks a fully working Windows version. The actual Windows installing process of KStars is slightly troublesome, especially for a user with no programming background. Therefore, developing a Windows version of KStars is crucial in the further development of KStars as it is one of the main astronomy software out there. It would fill a gap in KStars's reliability and would certainly make KStars more popular and appealing to everyone.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>Selecting multiple files in any file manager for copying and pasting has never been a pleasant experience, especially if the files are in a non-continuous order. Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the entire selection of files.</p>\n<p>This is an original project with a novel solution to this problem. My solution is to add a virtual folder in all KIO applications, where the links to files and folders can be temporarily saved. The files and folders are \"staged\" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using all the regular file management operations such as Move, Copy and Paste, or by drag and drop. Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it.</p>\n",

My primary goal is to help the KDE Community in this immense task, by porting the keyboard input modules, with modern designs provided by the KDE Visual Design Group (VDG).</p>\n<p>Another additional goal is to integrate the input method configurations, such as ibus or fcitx, into the System Settings application. Currently, the only way to install / configure these input methods is to install it from a package manager and use the GUI provided by the input method, which is far from discoverable. The ability to add / remove and configure IMEs will improve user experience for a global audience.</p>\n",

In the current implementation of KDE Partition Manager, all the privileged tasks such as executing some external program like btrfs, sfdisk etc. Or copying a block of data from one partition to the other, which requires escalated permissions to execute are executed by a helper non GUI application. So, instead of running whole GUI application (KDE Partition Manager) as root or superuser, a helper non GUI application is spawned which runs as root and executes privileged tasks. This helper program communicates with KDE Partition Manager over simple DBus protocol. The current implementation may seem a good idea, but is not, the reason being that KAuth is an extra layer added over Polkit-qt which causes extra overhead.\n So, the proposal for this project is to port all the authentication/authorization code from KAuth to Polkit-qt without effecting the original behaviour of KDE Partition Manager.</p>\n",

SDDM used in conjunction with Plasma, however, results in certain issues, some of which fall under the guise of consistency between the login screen and the desktop. In practice this means that as soon as there is any relevant veering from Plasma defaults, the login manager no longer provides an identical visual experience. This GSoC project would try to solve that very issue by adding the possibility of syncing the desktop and login manager options. Options that could be synced are: color scheme, font, font size, font rendering, icon theme (obtained from the Plasma theme). Rather than adding discrete options, the suggestion is to have only one option that would pertain to syncing SDDM settings with a particular user’s settings. Patching SDDM to support Plasma wallpapers would also fall within the scope of the project. Most importantly, because desktop display scaling preferences are likewise not respected in SDDM, the project would also tackle the issue of allowing users to set a display scaling preference via GUI.</p>\n",

They come in two forms: bitmap textures, which are images contained in e.g. PNG or OpenEXR files, or procedural textures, which are generated on the fly using their mathematical representation.</p>\n<p>KDE’s Krita painting suite supports using patterns and textures through two types of layers, File or Fill Layers. However, neither of them let artists create dynamically generated content: File Layers are inherently static, and Fill Layers support only color fills (like Paint Layers) or basic pattern rendering.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to let artists create dynamic content through a new, scriptable Fill Layer.

This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence,  we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use",

They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case).\n\nDiscover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks.\n\nThe project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks.\n\nPLAN TO IMPLEMENT:\nThe project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. \n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application\n2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application\n3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages\n4. implementation of an \"internal dictionary\" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",

As part of this goal, KDE aims to measure the energy consumption of its software and eco-certify applications with the Blue Angel ecolabel.\nCurrently, we measure the energy consumption of our software using a lab based in Berlin following the process documented in the KDE Eco Handbook (Handbook: Applying The Blue Angel Criteria To Free Software).\nThe lab setup requires (i) a test PC (System Under Test) to run user-emulation scripts, (ii) a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the test PC, and (iii) another PC (Data Aggregator & Evaluator) to collect and analyze the output data. In the current setup, developers must rely on individuals in Berlin to test software for them on-site in the lab.\nThis proposal aims to provide remote access to the lab in two steps: first, automating the energy measurement process, including providing a summary of the results; and second, setting up backend CI/CD integration for measuring energy consumption.\nBy automating the process and providing remote access, we make it possible for developers to measure the energy consumption of their software from any location in the world. The increased access to the lab will enable data-driven decision-making for efficiency improvements in code and software eco-certification with agencies like the Blue Angel.\nThe proposed project has three main goals:\ni) Measurement Automation: Implement a solution where a developer provides as input three scripts (baseline, idle mode, and standard usage scenario) with a config file and automatically obtains a summary of results from  OSCAR (Open source Software Consumption Analysis in R).\nii) Remote Access 1: Implement a CI/CD pipeline as a backend solution for performing the energy consumption measurements in the remote energy measurement lab.",

Currently, Kdenlive saves its subtitles in the SRT format, which only allows very basic styling features - that means only one style for the complete subtitle file. A more advanced file format like ASS (SubStation Alpha Subtitles) would allow much more powerful styling, for example attributing different styles to different speakers, proper styling (using bold, italic or colors on words or sentences only), etc. Currently, Kdenlive can already read basic ASS files (without styling support). I'll improve Kdenlive's support for ASS files. Expecting results include opening and saving an ASS subtitle and keeping the styling infos, implementing a widget allowing to create styles and attribute a style to a subtitle sentence, and adding some attributes like bold to selected parts of the text.",

However, as of today, the support for Javascript within Okular is lacking. A lot of pre-defined javascript form functions are either partially implemented or not implemented. This often breaks form functionality for the users. Also at present, many essential objects and functionalities outlined in the PDF Javascript API Reference specification are either only partially implemented or completely absent. This leads to a lot of bug reports regarding broken form support for Okular. This project aims to resolve this, by improving the Javascript support for PDF forms.

Karton, the KDE Virtual Machine Manager, will be able to better integrate with Plasma and can align with the goals of KDE.  This project will use the libvirt API rather than the QEMU CLI, which abstracts away some of the low-level implementation details and potentially allow for the app to be cross-platform. \n\nA custom graphical viewer will need to be implemented using the SPICE protocol. Registering mouse and keyboard input callbacks should also allow users to interact with virtual machines. Virtual machines created with Karton should be fully customizable through libvirt's domain XML file format. Karton should also have the feature to create snapshots in order to load previous and save states of the virtual machine. \n\nOverall, the ultimate goal is to create a polished virtual machine manager that is able to replace our available alternatives.",

This change will\nallow us to remove the inclusion of heavy QtWidgets header files, which currently\nlead to unnecessary memory usage. Reducing this overhead is essential for making\nthe Merkuro suite fully usable on mobile devices, where resource constraints are\ncritical.\nAt present, many components load their GUI elements by default, unnecessarily\nincreasing the memory footprint and hindering performance on resource-constrained\nplatforms. By refactoring these configuration dialogs into separate, dynamically\nloaded plugins, the agents and resources can run leaner and more efficiently (it\nwould save around 15-20 Mib of RAM per agent/resource) while still providing\nfull-featured configuration interfaces when needed by host applications.\nProject Deliverables\n● Refactor as many as reasonably possible of the selected Akonadi agents\nand resources within the GSoC timeframe. The goal is not necessarily to port\nall agents, but to make meaningful progress and establish a repeatable\npattern for others to follow, ensuring the project is successful even if not every\ntarget is completed.\n● Eliminate embedded QtWidgets dependencies—such as replacing\nQApplication with QCoreApplication—in their primary functionality.\n● Identify and replace additional usages of QtWidgets beyond the configuration\ndialogs—such as QMessageBox instances used to show error messages.\n● Modify build configurations (CMake files) to strip out unnecessary UI files and\nreduce dependencies, thereby lowering memory usage.\n● Create dedicated configuration plugins that encapsulate the GUI functionality\npreviously embedded within agents and resources.\n● Test and document all changes to verify that memory usage is indeed reduced\nand that the new plugin-based configuration system functions correctly across\nboth desktop and mobile environments.",
