The goal of this project is to improve and expand end-to-end (E2E) test coverage using Playwright, so that the Meshery UI and workflows stay reliable even as new changes come in.\n\nI'll start by understanding the current test setup and structure, identify gaps or flaky tests, and then refactor or write new Playwright tests that are modular and clean. These tests will be fully integrated with the CI (GitHub Actions), ensuring they run with every PR and provide quick feedback.\n\nDeliverables include new E2E tests for major workflows, fixes for unstable tests, performance improvements through parallelization, updated documentation for contributors, and a more robust CI test pipeline. I'll be actively collaborating with the Meshery community throughout",
