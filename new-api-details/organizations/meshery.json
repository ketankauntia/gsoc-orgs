  "description": "As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n\nMeshery is for all cloud and cloud native infrastructure.  Kubernetes-centric. Kubernetes not required.\n\nInfrastructure diversity is a reality for any enterprise. Whether you’re running a single Kubernetes cluster or multiple Kubernetes clusters, on one cloud or multiple clouds, you’ll find that Meshery supports your infrastructure diversity (or lack thereof).\n\nMeshery is for engineering teams. Whether you are a Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Developer, or Operator, Meshery provides a platform for you to collaborate on the design and operation of your cloud native infrastructure.\n\nWhether making a Day 0 adoption choice, a Day 1 configuration and provisioning, or maintaining a Day 2 deployment, Meshery has useful capabilities in either circumstance. Targeted audience for Meshery project would be any technology operators that leverage Cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n\nMeshery is like Google Docs for DevOps. Using Meshery extensions you can freely collaborate across projects and team with multi-player infrastructure design and operation.\n\nMeshery enables cloud native best practices with design patterns and the Meshery Catalog. Through Models, Meshery describes infrastructure under management, enabling you to define cloud native designs and patterns and then to export those designs and share within the Meshery Catalog.",

The goal of this project is to improve and expand end-to-end (E2E) test coverage using Playwright, so that the Meshery UI and workflows stay reliable even as new changes come in.\n\nI'll start by understanding the current test setup and structure, identify gaps or flaky tests, and then refactor or write new Playwright tests that are modular and clean. These tests will be fully integrated with the CI (GitHub Actions), ensuring they run with every PR and provide quick feedback.\n\nDeliverables include new E2E tests for major workflows, fixes for unstable tests, performance improvements through parallelization, updated documentation for contributors, and a more robust CI test pipeline. I'll be actively collaborating with the Meshery community throughout",
