The functionalities developed concerns search functions, the improvement of the  several tools (hexdump, disasm...) and the development of the graph module with a new library with the ability to have more representations. This project will also permit the usage of the T command of r2 binary to send and read messages through the UI. In the same way, the scripting area that allows the user to make some automation will be improved to be more friendly and authorize new usages. In resume, this work will allow to improve drastically the comfort in the use of r2.</p>\n",

A program trace contains all states of a running process in time so that users can analyze the program execution at any point in time quickly. Besides, a new timeless debugging view is implemented in Cutter to provide more in-depth analysis with information from the trace. In addition, this project implements network support for WinDbg/KD debugger and remote debugging support for qira and kgdb.</p>\n",
