Testing servers for compliance with XMPP extensions is a very cumbersome process in which a server admin or willing user has to download the jar, run it and make a PR to the repo with the results to add it in the overview page. Through this project, I intend to automate this process and turn this project to a web service, which will provide a interface for testing servers, periodically run tests on public servers and visualise current and historic compliance status of servers, implementation of XMPP extensions across servers. Custom badges will be generated for servers from the latest test results. Periodic reports will be generated from the test results and sent to subscribers. Moreover, the collected historical data can also be analysed to recommend appropriate Jabber servers for users.</p>\n",
