This not only places a high amount of responsibility on the user, it also poses a security risk if they accidentally open the file locally, calling for a shutdown of the Virtual Machine in order to eliminate any potential damage caused by the file's execution.</p>\n<h3>The Proposal</h3>\n<p>In this proposal a more convenient and less error-prone method of opening untrusted files is presented. By allowing the user to mark a folder, file or file type as untrusted, the need for a user to constantly keep themselves in check is eliminated, and unnecessary actions that must be frequently repeated during the course of working with sensitive or semi-trusted data are discarded.</p>\n<p>These features and implementations are discussed in detail along with possible future developments should there be excess time towards the end of the event. The proposal concludes with a complete timeline as well as a description of myself, my community experience and various methods of keeping in contact.</p>\n",

Using time based one-time passwords instead of simple static secret text helps avoid screen observation based attacks. Installation of the improved AEM on removable media along with usage of Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) key files deters keyboard observation, as an attacker would also need to seize the boot media. These enhancements are then made even stronger by adding revokable TPM assisted anti-replay protection for AEM secrets.</p>\n",

Although it is possible to forward ports by issuing iptables commands on both the NetworkVM and the FirewallVM, or by using the ConnectTCP service, it is a limited and error prone manual process. Furthermore, the lack of a GUI that shows the manual rules  fives the user a lack of oversight on the firewall.</p>\n<p>The goal of the project is to mplement a GUI for automatic and persistent, eventually with a predefined timespan (ie: until reboot), port forwarding. The idea is to split horizontally the \"Firewall Rules\" tab in the \"Qubes Settings\" window and add another area below it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, discuss and verify the possibility to implement a secure NAT traversal system and GUI.\nA basic proposal could be a checkbox to enable NAT traversal requests. When the checkbox is selected, the FirwallVM will redirect NAT traversal requests to a local python daemon or a dedicated VM that will negotiate the NAT traversal and configure the network accordingly. In this case, prompt the user in Dom0 about the NAT traversal request.</p>\n<p>Of course the qvm-* set of tools must e able to achieve the same tasks via CLI.</p>\n",
