Quickly becoming an industry standard, OpenVDB is a Volume rendering framework developed by Dreamworks that sees wide usage throughout the graphics industry such as in Pixar's RenderMan and Houdini. It is known for its efficiency in handling sparse data sets and its wide range of filters, transformation operators, compositing tools, and many other features for the creation and robust manipulation of Volumes.

Volumetric soft body simulation can be used to capture the complex details of muscle and skin, e.g. volume preservation under collision/compression. In visual effects, such methods must also be robust to extreme deformation (no numerical blow-ups) and fast enough for interactive manipulation. Moreover, many of the underlying material models are nonlinear and computationally expensive, such as hyper-elastic models for realistic tissue or artistically-defined deformation. Toward these challenges I propose the implementation of a volumetric soft body solver in Blender, that is not only rapid and robust, but is general to hyper-elastic materials. The solver will also be capable of robustly resolving self-collisions and possibly other constraints. This would greatly improve the use of physics in Blender for animation pipelines.</p>\n",

However, when it comes to its user interface, Blender still doesn’t feel quite properly integrated within the macOS environment. This GSoC proposal aims to change this, with the goal of making Blender feel closer to a fully native macOS application.\n\nThis proposal plans to improve the Blender macOS user experience by incorporating part of the Blender interface into the macOS interface. Effectively making it closer to the macOS Human Interface Guidelines, and providing macOS Blender users with a familiar experience, more tightly integrated into their operating system.\n\nTo achieve this goal, this proposal will focus on the improvements of two main UI elements: the macOS menu bar and title bar. While this proposal will focus on macOS implementation, a byproduct of it will be the creation of an unified interface for native menu bar items, which will then make it possible to implement such functionality on other OS and Desktop Environments in the future.",

Currently, these conditions are not exposed to the user, but use the wrap condition across different sampling methods. The conditions should also be selectable in the node giving more freedom to the users.\n\nLastly, there is one sampling method that requires some special attention – BLI_ewa_filter. \nCurrently, the EWA sampling uses different implementations across CPU and GPU, leading to different results on different devices/OSs. Blender uses EWA sampling primarily for anisotropic texture sampling. The goal is to write an implementation of the EWA filter for the CPU, which is transferable to the GPU, aiming for similar/equal results for CPU and GPU versions, allowing it to be used in the compositor to enable anisotropic compositing.",

Sculpting can become unresponsive on dense geometry, especially on lower-end hardware, so this effort focuses on optimizing performance at a low level.\n\nKey areas of development include spatially sorting mesh vertex data to enhance cache coherence, implementing smarter undo data storage through compression techniques, and introducing multithreading within nodes to make better use of CPU resources.\n\nThe intended outcome is a noticeably more responsive sculpting experience for artists, with faster interaction and improved overall performance.",

It will enable artists to edit symmetrically without relying on workarounds like deleting half the model to apply a mirror modifier which is a method impractical for nearly finished models and incompatible with shape keys, which require actual vertex positions rather than modifier-driven symmetry. I’ll analyze the transformation system, refine the mirroring utilities, and extend support to operators that do not support mirroring. The deliverables include these enhancements, detailed documentation for users and developers, and a set of tests to ensure consistent operation. This will make symmetrical modeling more efficient for artists.",
