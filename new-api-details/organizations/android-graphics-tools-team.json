Among its tools are a shader generator, which mutates a shader program into variants that differ in machine code, but render a similar image to the original - and a shader reducer, which reduces shader code to focus on specific logic that a user is interested in. Used in tandem, these tools allow one to fuzz test shader compilers for flaws and easily reproduce them.</p>\n<p>The generator mutates a shader by performing \"transformations\" on the original code which complicate control/data flow. These transformations often make use of OpenGL's built-in functions and features to mutate expressions into equivalent forms.</p>\n<p>However, the generator and reducer are only aware of a subset of the OpenGL shader language, and do not support all of OpenGL's built-in math and transformation functions. This reduces the number of potential mutations and ultimately hampers GraphicsFuzz's capability of finding edge cases.</p>\n<p>This project aims to enhance GraphicsFuzz's support for OpenGL semantics and extend its capabilities with new transformations, then apply them to open-source drivers.</p>\n",

It applies <em>semantics-preserving transformations</em> to a <em>SPIR-V</em> module, that we call the <em>reference</em> module, to obtain a modified <em>variant</em> module. Theoretically, a <em>semantics-preserving transformation</em> should not change the behaviour of the code. In this way, the <em>reference</em> and <em>variant</em> modules can be run, and the outputs compared. The output is usually an image. If the images differ, this probably indicates a shader compiler bug.

Thus, our task involves expanding the set of transformations by building sets of transformation classes and writing their corresponding tests and fuzzer passes.</p>\n<p>Our main task involves the WebGPU Shading Language, a new shading language featured by WebGPU. Since web browsers will have WebGPU, a secure implementation is crucial. To achieve a high test coverage, we use coverage-guided fuzzing. It uses program instrumentation to trace the code coverage reached by each input fed to a fuzz target. The information is then used to make informed decisions that maximize coverage, and thus increase the effectiveness of finding software bugs and security vulnerabilities. This project involves automatic fuzzing using LibFuzzer. Since LibFuzzer-based custom mutators mutate test cases in a domain-specific way, effective designing and implementing Tint-specific custom mutators are essential for this project to succeed.</p>\n",
