Julia programs are executed by a virtual machine that translates the source code, during run-time, to machine code based on the LLVM compiler framework. LLVM provides a variety of analyses and transformation capabilities that are leveraged to optimize programs and facilitate efficient execution. More recently, LLVM was enhanced by a new optimization framework, namely Polly, that supports automatic parallelization and data-locality optimizations based on the polyhedral model. Polly is able to speed up compute kernels significantly, especially in the context of dense linear algebra and iterative stencil computations. In the course of this project I plan to integrate Polly into Julia to enable polyhedral optimizations for Julia programs.</p>\n",

While many solvers are currently found in ODE.jl, there are still many which are awaiting a native Julia implementation in the package. In particular, there is a lack of implicit solvers implemented in ODE.jl (currently, there is only one implicit solver: ode23s). Such solvers are important because they are especially suited for solving stiff ODEs, which are very common. In light of this, the first goal of my proposed project is a native implementation of implicit solvers RADAU and MEBDFI. Further, in order to reliably use ODE.jl, a robust initial value problem (IVP) testing suite for ODE.jl solvers is a necessity. Work has has been started towards this end through the development of IVPTestSuite.jl. Though, there are many improvements to IVPTestSuite.jl which could be made, especially in improving the ODE solver performance tracking. Thus, the second goal of my proposed project is to advance IVPTestSuite.jl and its surrounding documentation.</p>\n",

Crucial to the efficiency of such tools, especially as parameter dimensions increase, are tools like HMC, which allow use differentiation and/or conjugacy for continuous parameters, so that fitting is not solely a matter of getting lucky with random Metropolis-Hastings proposals. Yet some models, especially nonparametric ones, also require discrete parameters and/or hand-written jump steps; and existing tools for HMC generally don't play well with discrete parameters. My project is intended to generally improve the Julia toolchain for MCMC when there is a mix of continuous and discrete parameters. My work will be based on Mamba.jl; though when I can make something that will be useful to Klara.jl too, even better. To make that plan concrete, I'll be implementing CrossCat, a general-purpose nonparametric model for \"medium-size\" tabular data including missingness and various data types.

However, the “inverse problem”, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit. This inverse problem usually considers a cost function to be optimized (such as maximum likelihood). This problem has applications in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study.</p>\n",

It is an essential task in many biological studies today, including population and medical studies. The initial stages of de-novo assembly require the construction of a de-bruijn graph (DBG) from sequencing reads, the compression of a de-bruijn graph into a unitig graph, and the compression of multiple unitigs and nodes into contigs, supported by evidence from mapping paired-end reads. A coherent ecosystem of computational tools and packages allow researchers to quickly implement and test their ideas. For bioinformatics, Julia already offers such an ecosystem in the form of the BioJulia &amp; EcoJulia projects, and additional independent packages.\nThis project will add sequence assembly tools to the BioJulia ecosystem, specifically: 1) DBG construction from reads, 2) UG construction from a DBG and 3) Constructing contigs using unitigs. These tools will allow researchers to quickly construct and analyze the contigs obtained from a set of reads.</p>\n",

Recently, new promising classes of high-order methods for the weak approximation of stochastic differential equations were introduced and those solvers are yet to be implemented in the library. On top of that, Julia currently lacks adjoint sensitivity methods for stochastic differential equations. Adding these tools to the broader ecosystem of DifferentialEquations will attract researchers that seek to simulate (or even control) the dynamics as generated by stochastic differential equations. Possible fields of application range from the simulation of (bio-)chemical processes over financial modeling to quantum mechanics.</p>\n",

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have greatly increased productivity of probabilistic modelers, allowing practitioners to focus on modeling, as opposed to the implementing algorithms for probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian) inference. Turing is a PPL developed entirely in Julia and is both expressive and fast due partly to Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler being implemented in LLVM.  Consequently, Turing has a more manageable code base and has the potential to be more extensible when compared to more established PPLs like STAN. One thing that may lead to the adoption of Turing is more benchmarks and feature comparisons of Turing to other mainstream PPLs. The aim of this project is to provide a more systematic approach to comparing execution times and features among several PPLs, including STAN, Pyro, nimble, and Tensorflow probability for a variety of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, which are a class of models that provide a much modeling flexibility and often allow model complexity to increase with data size.</p>\n",

Today, rolling out a new model has become ever easier with the popularization of open-source frameworks such as scikit-learn and MLJ. Despite the unprecedented accessibility, designing effective models with appropriate hyperparameters remains obscure for the common user without high-level technical understanding and expert intuition. In an effort to automate the process of tweaking hyperparameters, MLJ has introduced a unified interface for tuning models, providing support for widely used strategies like grid and random search. The available schemes, however, primarily perform exhaustive testings on selected hyperparameter combinations. In this proposal, I present a plan to implement a new strategy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which utilizes information from past attempts to improve hyperparameter search. The first section offers a summary of the method and existing implementations, while the second sketches the technical details of a PSO algorithm for MLJ and a tentative timeline to deliver the project’s goals.</p>\n",

This enables performant, standardized graph  algorithms which are easily differentiable by modern auto-diff tools. In this JSOC 2021 project I aim to provide automatic differentiation rules for all of the operations in the GraphBLAS C API which admit such rules. The SuiteSparse GraphBLAS (SS:GrB) implementation will be the primary target, and support for the several extensions to the specification in SS:GrB is also a goal. The primary application I am pursuing is an efficient implementation of graph machine learning in Julia, but it should be noted that graph computation and generalized sparse linear algebra have incredibly broad use cases including graph algorithms like breadth first search, and faster neural networks by taking advantage of sparsity and operators faster than typical multiplication.</p>\n",

Hence PPLs usually come with built-in algorithms to perform Bayesian inference on such models automatically. However, due to the expressiveness of PPLs, it is very challenging to design general purpose inference algorithms for models specified in Turing-complete PPLs. Applications tend to build their own custom inference machines, which is time consuming and labour intensive. \nThis proposal puts forward a recently introduced framework—the involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo (iMCMC), as a candidate for inference in a PPL, namely Turing. Such a framework would enable the automation of an implementation of a correct inference algorithm from user specifications in Turing. Moreover, Turing readily supports differentiable programming (in their HMC implementation) which is the main technical requirement of iMCMC. Early iMCMC developments in Gen show promising results compared to standard black box styled inferences. Hence, it would be desirable to have an implementation in Turing.</p>\n",

On the other hand, notebooks lack debugging tools and waste a lot of space in their layouts.\n\nA straightforward and extensible solution that uses the REPL and customizes it to our needs can bridge this feature and convenience gap. The TermLayouts.jl project aims to add extensions to the REPL and introduce a layout in which these extensions can be moved and resized to fit the user's needs. This layout can further be customized using a configuration file.\n\nThis project will also seek to provide some essential extensions which most users would like to have.

DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia.\nTo reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU.\nWe believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation.\nI aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",

Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question \"What is the set containing all possible final states?\" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for  both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation.\nThe goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization. The final result will be a state-of-the-art (SOTA) toolbox for reachability analysis with sparse polynomial zonotopes, together with systematic benchmarks comparing our Julia implementation both to different implementations of the same approach and other SOTA approaches in reachability analysis.",

There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package.\nThere is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",

Potential quantum memories, repeaters, and switches are being researched all over the world, and the quantum hardware race has started.  Therefore, a need for efficient, functional, and accurate open-source quantum networking modelling tools has never been more imminent. Projects such as Julia’s QuantumClifford.jl enable researchers across the globe to research various aspects of quantum networking while anticipating the creation of the necessary hardware to produce laboratory experiments. They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. \n\nIn classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates?  \n\nSimulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",

Combined with a RAG pipeline as an embedding and retrieval backend, ColBERT can make the usage of existing AI tools really powerful. As part of the project, we also aim to apply this model to Julia's own extensive documentation (over thousands of packages), and integrate ColBERT with AIHelpMe.jl and PromptingTools.jl. Combine this with a locally hosted LLM, all Julia users get a powerful, modular, and easily hackable local AI assistant, allowing them to integrate ColBERT with their own RAG pipelines.\n\nThe main deliverable of the project will be a new package (called ColBERT.jl), with the implementation design inspired from the original Python implementation of ColBERTv2.0 (i.e the centroids + residuals compression method). The project will also have an extensive number of addons, including, but not limited to, implementing the training module for this package, which will allow users to train their own ColBERT models instead of relying on pretrained checkpoints, and distributed training (using existing art like DaggerFlux.jl).",

As a result, Bayesian inference lags other areas of machine learning in the availability of common benchmarks. To help solve this, the Stan team put together posteriordb, described as:\n\n\"a set of posteriors, i.e. Bayesian statistical models and data sets, reference implementations in probabilistic programming languages, and reference posterior inferences.\" (posteriordb Github readme).\n\n\n\nThis proposal would add Turing implementations for most of these models,  facilitating easier sampler benchmarking in Turing. This database would also serve as a set of examples of Turing best practices. The project will result in a database of 120+ varied Bayesian models written in Turing, representing translations of a database of corresponding Stan models. \n\nRegarding deliverables, the proposal pdf contains a detailed and complete schedule, directly blocking out time for 130+ of the posteriors, with some additional stretch goals included. As a summary, \n\n(1) Initial weeks are spent getting familiar with Turing best practices while building out 50+ of the simplest models (mostly, variants of Bayesian regression).\n\n(2) Weeks leading up to the midterm assessment are blocked off for GLMMs and Bayesian ODEs.\n\n(3) Weeks following the midterm assessment are dedicated to two types of discrete models — first, models with a discrete structure amenable to simply summing out the discrete components (e.g. mixture models). Second, I'll implement HMMs, which require some specific algorithms to match the Stan posteriors.\n\n(4) Chip away at remaining models that don't neatly fit into a specific category, for example, neural networks, splines, and gaussian processes. \n\nIf a week ends with models incomplete, I'll move on to the next week, ensuring a varied selection of models make it into the database.",

          "description": "This project aims to significantly enhance the search experience within documentation generated by Documenter.jl. The current client-side search encounters difficulties accurately indexing and retrieving results for Julia-specific syntax, leading to suboptimal relevance. Furthermore, issues like unnecessarily large search indices and repeated listing of the same location hinder usability. This proposal outlines a plan to address these shortcomings by: 1) Implementing search performance benchmarks (relevance, precision/recall, index size) to measure and guide improvements. 2) Developing and integrating an improved, Julia-aware tokenizer within the search JavaScript. 3) Optimizing the index by investigating and removing redundant data, ensuring unique location entries are stored, and adding warnings for potentially problematic large indices. 4) Creating comprehensive developer documentation for the enhanced search system. The outcome will be a more robust, accurate, and efficient search capability for users navigating Julia package documentation.",

The project aims to create a package within the Julia language ecosystem to allow businesses and individuals to employ time series forecasting. This package will leverage optimized data structures and parallel computing to minimize space and time complexities, ensuring high performance for large-scale forecasting tasks. The primary deliverables include: Adding support for time series forecasting methods, like forecasting intermittent demand (INARMA and Croston) and seasonal forecasting (ARIMA and ETS), while also allowing loss based forecasting using machine learning models (XGBoost); Including methods to evaluate and compare different models; Implementing tools for data analysis, specifically, rolling statistics, unit root tests (for stationarity), distribution histograms (for outliers), and periodicity detection algorithms; Providing visualization features for plotting; Supplying detailed documentation for the package, including function definitions with parameter specifications, and tutorials which use native datasets. The project aims to fill a gap in Julia's ecosystem by implementing these features, encouraging users to switch to Julia for time series analysis. The package will combine statistical robustness with computational efficiency, making sophisticated forecasting accessible to a broader range of users.",

This project proposes a browser-based graphical model editor for JuliaBUGS, enabling users to visually construct probabilistic graphical models by adding nodes and drawing arrows, instead of writing code. Built using React with TypeScript and React Flow, the web interface will support adding, connecting, grouping, and editing random variables and deterministic nodes via an interactive canvas. Users can specify probability distributions and hyperparameters through intuitive forms. The editor will export model structures to JSON and generate valid JuliaBUGS (or BUGS) code. The GSoC project will focus entirely on delivering a polished, user-friendly frontend with clear usage examples and tutorials. Inspired by tools like DoodleBUGS (for WinBUGS or MultiBUGS), shinystan, and the R Package causact, this editor aims to make model specification more accessible and streamline the Bayesian modeling workflow.",

The second objective is to implement an efficient Remote Memory Access (RMA) communication strategy to replace traditional Point-to-Point methods. This change will help reduce memory and synchronization overhead and optimize data movement across distributed memory systems. Finally, to address the current O(M×N) complexity caused by the SIMD execution model, the project proposes a transition to a MIMD model using Multi-level Graph Partitioning. This approach will partition the execution Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into smaller, optimized subgraphs, significantly reducing redundant computations and enhancing parallel efficiency. To achieve these goals, we plan to conduct extensive benchmarking tests on the implementations. This will ensure the code is clear and well-documented, enabling future developers to use it freely.",
