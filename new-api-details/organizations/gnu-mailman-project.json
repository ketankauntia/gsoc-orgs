This project will make it easier for users to create new styles and apply them to a list by providing them a web interface(as a part of Postorius) that will enable them to create new styles, edit/copy/inherit existing ones and apply them to a mailing list. For example, if a user wants to change whether Mailman sends a message to the unsubscriber when he/she leaves the mailing list, then, he would just change the 'send_goodbye_message' attribute in the style being used by that particular list and all done!!! The web interface will help the administrators in managing the styles with just a few click without having them to type long commands at shell. This will enhance the overall user experience.</p>\n",

          "description": "<p>With the adoption of stricter email authentication policies to curb spam, intermediate mail handlers like mailing lists suffer potential problems of getting their mails flagged as spam and returning undelivered. The solution for this lies in the recently drafted IETF ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) protocol. From Mailman's point of view, ARC is a protocol that can help mitigate denial of service to subscribed addresses at Yahoo!, AOL, and other sites that have a <code>p = reject</code> DMARC policy. With Google too set to migrate to a DMARC <code>p=reject</code> policy in the near future, the importance of the ARC protocol has become more significant.Basically, setting up ARC would allow Mailman to securely register its handling of the message, thus allowing the set-up of a trust mechanism between Mailman and the involved MTAs and hence reducing the denial of service.</p>\n",
