It also provides faster debugging of pre-existing bugs even by new developers, as they can easily jump to class/method definitions without having prior knowledge of the directory structure of the project. Sorbet serves as a tool to reduce brittle code, increases a developer’s confidence in their work and is a great tool for refactoring.
