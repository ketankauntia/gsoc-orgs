The two constructs introduced in Rogas  are: CLUSTER-BY and RANK-BY, which play an important role in analyzing the topological structure that lies beneath based entities and relationships. However, local community search queries are still needed in Rogas framework. In a local community search query, the objective is to find the communities that are associated with a given set of query vertices. Implementation of local community search functionality needs careful modeling into NAER model as well.</p>\n<p>The proposed project aims at adding the local community search functionality into Rogas. This makes Rogas a more general framework that covers a broader range of network analytics applications. Moreover, this project aims at implementing and instantiation of three local community detection techniques chosen from the state-of-the-art ones in the field of network analytics. This can bring Rogas a new level of functionality with a more detailed coverage of network analytics applications.</p>\n",
