This can be one of the reasons why CircuitVerse’s maximum traffic is from developed countries with above-average or good internet connectivity like the USA(26%), India(11%), UK(6%) and Canada(4%). It would be a big step towards increasing accessibility to have an offline App. Hence, I propose the third part of my proposal: An offline electron app for CircuitVerse.</p>\n",

It has allowed users to write, experiment, and test their Verilog code along with graphical circuit design using CV simulator. But currently, the Verilog feature is full of bugs, unstable, and unreliable which leads to its failure and causes loss of trust in CircuitVerse among its userbase. The project aims to fix the bugs, make the Verilog feature stable, refine the Verilog interface, make it more intuitive, enable users to generate, view, edit, test circuits comprehensively, and fix the testbench generation feature for Verilog code. Other goals include adding detailed documentation for Verilog and added improvements to assist users. Additional enhancements like adding play/pause functionality to simulator, and implementing full-screen view for the Boolean Logic Table is also covered in this project.",
