As the Go+ebpf user-base is growing, it would be useful to have the possibility to probe the kernel for available ebpf features from other userspace programs written in Go without having to shell out to <code>bpftool</code>.\nThis proposal is about adding a feature probe API to cilium/ebpf that gives users a standardized interface to query the kernel for available ebpf features, furthermore encouraging the use of Go within a fast growing ebpf community.</p>\n",

However, most of the applied configurations can be seen by viewing the ConifgMap in the Kubernetes cluster. The main issue is that ConfigMap does not stay reconciled with the active daemon configurations. This means that if we change any configuration in the ConfigMap, it is not immediately reflected in Cilium. Cilium needs to be restarted to apply those configurations. Depending on kernel configurations, It may happen that ConfigMap and daemon both show different active configurations. So, this project aims at improving the existing <code>cilium config</code> command to expose all active configurations.</p>\n<p>Add subcommand :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>cilium encrypt status,</code> which displays information on the current status of the IPSec configurations </li>\n<li><code>cilium encrypt flush,</code> which flushes the current XFRM States of the node.</li>\n</ol>\n",

In addition, Cilium is a CNI plugin for Kubernetes.\nCilium can manage network access control by using network policy functions, called “CiliumNetworkPolicy” (CNP). Users can allow or deny specific traffic by applying a CNP. However, currently, any traffic except for TCP/UDP (including ICMP) is denied if an L4 CNP is present, and there is no way for the user to explicitly allow ICMP traffic. Therefore, I propose to implement a CNP for explicitly allowing ICMP traffic.</p>\n",
