Therefore, malware analysis tools dissect and analyze the behavior of malicious entities at run-time. In this way, security analysts can deduct the cause of infection, e.g., to provide necessary means for potential countermeasures. DRAKVUF is an open source malware analysis framework running on top of the Xen hypervisor. By using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques, DRAKVUF is able to transparently monitor and control the state of a virtual machine from a level beyond the OS. While DRAKVUF is a powerful means to analyze malware, its use is currently limited to x86-64 based architectures. This project aims to shift the scope of application of DRAKVUF towards ARM and thus the mobile market ultimately providing powerful malware analysis on mobile devices.</p>\n",

Defending and fighting against malicious attacks requires tools and techniques to recognize their origin, family, actor, purpose and modus operandi. In this project, I will develop a system that can use a wide range of malware analytic outputs (source code, DNS/ASN data, peinfo results, yara rules, IPs, domains etc.) to automatically detect relationships  between malicious objects in a database and assign a score to each detected relationship. This system should accept user requests for analytic jobs and utilize distributed machine learning techniques and tools in order to extract knowledge out of the malware-related Big Data available. The system output for the analyst should be a graphical representation of the generated results.</p>\n",

That’s why malware targeting ARM is becoming an even bigger threat every day. On the other hand, it is still the x86 architecture for which most reverse engineering tools are developed. This Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project aims to add ARM support for both the dynamic analysis framework DRAKVUF and the virtual machine introspection (VMI) library libvmi. The idea is to base our project upon the result of an earlier GSoC project which added altp2m support for Xen on ARM. The altp2m subsystem defines different views on the guest’s physical memory and allows to dynamically switch among them. With altp2m and DRAKVUF we are able to build a stealthy VMI framework. In summary, the goal of the GSoC project is to add support for DRAKVUF for ARM and thus provide more options for reverse engineering on the ARM architecture.</p>\n",

MISRA, the former leading C++ coding standard in the automotive industry, has recently adopted the AUTOSAR Standard because AUTOSAR addresses many advancements in C++ and its tools that did not exist when MISRA was created in 2008.\nThe goal of this project is to get the ball rolling for the open-source effort tackling AUTOSAR compliance. In the Bareflank fork of LLVM, this project will create a new group of checks associated with AUTOSAR under clang-tools-extra. Parts of AUTOSAR are based on existing C++ coding standards, but many new additional checks in C++ will need to be written. The checks will be aggregated in a new TidyModule, which will then be made available as a new AUTOSAR flag for clang-tidy.</p>\n",

The first is to use packet filter (pf) for macOS, initially trying to swallow all traffic coming from the same machine that is launching packet filter itself. The second step in this approach will be to use some gimmick to figure out which packets are actually coming from mitmproxy and filter them out to avoid loops, a possible solution for this could be to use nettop, launching it as a command directly from rust, the solution is not definitive and possible alternatives should be explored to understand the privilege issue as well.\n2. A second approach is to use NEAppProxyProvider: an Apple proprietary framework that extends the functionality of the iOS and MacOS network stack. With NEAPP we can implement custom rules for filtering, routing, and modifying network traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as the app, the network protocol, the destination address, or the user identity. As it is a proprietary framework, we need to develop in Swift or objective-C and then transmit the information to the main mitmproxy stack.\n\nHow other proxies or VPN actually work:\n- WireGuard: wireguard has a apple version written in Swift, the adopted approach is the second one, it uses Apple Network Interfaces [ source ]\n- Squid: the same problem is  currently unsolved\n- TinyProxy: it uses  POSIX and no https transparent proxy",

On the other hand, Spicy uses a higher-level, declarative style that simplifies these complexities, letting us focus more on understanding the protocol itself.",

The existing Go-based protocol handlers in Glutton will be reimagined through Spicy's grammar-based approach, creating parsers that precisely match the current implementation's behavior, including special case handling for attack vectors like Ethereum RPC exploits and Hadoop YARN vulnerabilities. The project involves the creation of a Go wrapper framework to integrate these Spicy-generated parsers with Glutton's architecture and the delivery of fully functional HTTP and DNS parsers. This work will demonstrate how specialized grammar-based protocol parsing can enhance Glutton's maintainability and extensibility while maintaining its effectiveness as a protocol-agnostic honeypot for security research.",
