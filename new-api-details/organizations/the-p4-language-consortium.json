This feature allows checkpointing containers within Kubernetes pods, and, with some additional steps, restoring them on a different node. This approach preserves active TCP connections of the container. However, workloads (e.g., web servers) with established TCP connections to the migrated container cannot make use of this feature, as the container IP changes after migrating to another node. This project implements a P4-based load balancer on the data plane that dynamically reroutes packets to the correct IP address after container migration. The goal is to make the migration invisible to the client, causing only a period of service unavailability, after which communication can be resumed without re-establishing the TCP connection. Deliverables of this project include a P4-based load balancer, control plane code for P4 runtime interaction, a minimal CNI plugin for Kubernetes integration, and performance benchmarks to demonstrate the system's effectiveness.",

Additionally, the current implementation of Sub-Treversal Partitioning (STP) incurs high CPU overhead during startup, minimizing the system's performance benefits. This project will optimize STP to reduce CPU usage and improve startup efficiency.\nFinally, Gigaflow’s newness requires further optimization in the compilation, LTM, and driver pipeline, alongside additional testing for alternative strategies for priority selection and rule deletion.

P4 software/simulated switches like BMv2 make the development even easier by having the programs and control plane run on developers' computers and give instant feedback. \n\nThis project aims to further improve the capability of BMv2 and enable a potentially broader insight for developers to analyze their P4 program. \n\nWhile traditionally one packet only goes through one path within the switch and thus obtains only one result, there are many situations where it is more useful to have all possible outputs from a P4 simulation. For example, we use this for diff testing, to determine whether the switch is doing something correct or something incorrect.\n\nMultiple allowed behaviors and results usually arise from various multi-path constructs (e.g. ECMP, WCMP, or perhaps LAGs) which are often modeled as action profiles/selector in P4. BMv2 currently allows users to set a mode determining action profile/selector behavior, like `round robin` where every time one sends in the same packet, it would invoke the next possible forwarding action (eventually wrapping around).\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide a new mode for BMv2 to output all possible behaviors. This will both require extending the action profile modes, and extending the notion of output from a set of packets to a set of sets of packets.",
