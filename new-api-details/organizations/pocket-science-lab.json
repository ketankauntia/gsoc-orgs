This helps students, teachers, undergraduates and hobbyists in numerous ways in their academics as well as projects.</p>\n<p>The project currently facilitates PSLab interfaces with <em>Android</em> and <em>Desktop</em> platforms. Desktop application is rather complete but the Android application is not. Both the applications need improvements more or less. The expected outcome by the end of this summer is to make these platforms fully functional with ease of use. Apart from these platforms, a <em>Web</em> interface will also be developed.</p>\n<p>These three complete platforms will increase the usability of <strong>PSLab</strong> device over almost any systems, be it Windows, Linux, Mac or Android. User will not have to spend hundreds of dollars on costly equipments to help with their projects and practicals anymore.</p>\n",
