There are plenty of bug reports due to its incompatibility with the newer version of ‘things’. Therefore we need to migrate both FLOE project and fluid project websites to a modern and well maintained Static Site Generator (as most of the content is static in nature and dynamic functionalities are not required). In addition to migrating to a modern static site generator, we need a Content Management System (for example Netlify CMS)  for automating the process of updating/adding new content and an Automation Server (for example Jenkins) which helps with continuous integration and facilitates technical aspects of continuous delivery to automate the build process.</p>\n",
