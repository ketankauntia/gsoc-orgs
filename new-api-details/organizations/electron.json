Newer manifest versions have been released, and several APIs in both Chrome and Electron have evolved, leading to its current non-functional state.\nApp developers who are new to Electron often find it challenging to understand IPC concepts and how to work with them.\nBuilding a completely new extension from scratch that tracks IPC events would be an effective approach to developing an IPC tracker that aligns with the requirements of the latest Manifest Version 3 and is fully compatible with the latest Chrome and Electron APIs.\nAdditionally, trackers for Event Listeners and Require Graph can also be added.\n\nA working prototype for the extension can be found on my GitHub : https://github.com/hitarth-gg/electron-tracker-prototype",

This API will offer a declarative way to configure window persistence behavior while accommodating complex edge cases automatically. The configuration object will be optional within the BrowserWindowConstructorOptions. The primary approach involves leveraging Chromium’s PrefService to store the window state as a JSON object.",
