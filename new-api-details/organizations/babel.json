Babel allows everyone to have access to future language features which make life easier, code cleaner, and give devs one less thing to worry about upgrading in next few months. As a side-note, I love things that compile to JavaScript, and I'm really excited about what I'll learn (AST manipulation, details of the JavaScript AST, lexing &amp; parsing) as a part of my work on Babel.</p>\n",
