It can be significantly improved in various ways to become a really useful tool for not only for ReactOS but for Windows users also who want to manage their installed applications like Steam manages games installation/updating.</p>\n<h3>Goals to achieve</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving UI, provide a smoother experience.</li>\n<li>Separate the download and install operations.</li>\n<li>Command-line support. (If possible, using Console API / VT Sequence to provide a better interface)</li>\n<li>Asynchronous Download Support. (Based On WinINet)</li>\n<li>Allow users to change default download source.</li>\n<li>Other features (like support silence installation, dependency analysis, etc.) might be added, need more discussion with my mentor and project members.</li>\n</ul>\n",
