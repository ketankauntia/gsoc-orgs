A much requested feature is Non-Destructive Editing (NDE) which would allow users to make changes without overwriting the original image. This would mean they can easily revert prior edits, modify the settings of filters to see live changes, and rearrange the order that effects are applied in. \n\nGIMP’s image processing engine GEGL is fully capable of many NDE operations. However, these features are not fully exposed to users. The goal of this project would be to enable Non-Destructive Editing on individual layers and layer groups through “Layer Effects” such as drop shadows and brightness/contrast filters. A basic implementation consists of three milestones:\n\n1. Research and design a NDE workflow that compliments GIMP’s current design and user base.\n\n2. Implement “Layer Effects” for GIMP’s regular and text layers as well as layer groups.\n\n3. Add support to the PSD plug-in to recognize and import equivalent “Layer Styles” and “Adjustment Layers” as NDE Layer Effects.",

Many closely-related programming models exist such as CUDA and OpenCL. OpenCL is a popular framework for writing massively parallel code given its broader ecosystem and supported platforms. GIMP is a popular free open-source image manipulation tool often shipped as the default tool in many Unix-based distributions. GIMP uses GEGL internally for accelerating various image processing tasks. GEGL comes with OpenCL implementations for many operations. However, the OpenCL backend in GEGL was often slower than the baselines and resulted in incorrect outputs (and crashed sometimes). The goal of this project is to enumerate all the existing OpenCL implementations in GEGL, write a thorough suite of tests for them, and fix as many implementations as possible. If time permits and once correctness is established via tests, the project adds new faster implementations for popular operations. A successful completion of the project would allow the OpenCL backend to be enabled by default and allow the end-users to take advantage of hardware acceleration on their devices automatically.",
