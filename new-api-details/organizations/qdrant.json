          "description": "Problem:\n\nQdrant, a vector search engine used for similarity search and clustering, lacks the necessary functionality to effectively visualize and explore vector data. This results in users relying on external tools or code to analyze and visualize their data, which can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. Thus, there is a critical gap in the platform's functionality that needs to be addressed.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo address this issue, a web-based user interface will be developed that will provide l an accessible and user-friendly platform for users to interact with and explore their vector data. This tool will allow users to quickly visualize their data, perform exploratory data analysis, and gain insights into their data without relying on external code. Additionally, a web-based interface will be more accessible to a broader range of users, including those without advanced programming or data analysis skills.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nThe proposed project aims to create a user-friendly web application with a comprehensive set of tools for managing and analyzing data. The application will be visually appealing, easy to use, and accessible on multiple devices. Documentation will also be provided to ensure ease of use and further development. The final deliverables will include a functional and deployable web-based UI for Qdrant that addresses the critical gap in the platform's functionality, making it more accessible, user-friendly, and practical for a wider range of users.",

However, this method can become sluggish when dealing with expansive areas and entails handling location data separately in a database.\r\nIntroducing a more efficient feature for intricate geo-filters would 1) speed up the process, 2) create opportunities for novel applications, 3) open the door for further opportunities of optimization. Such a feature would be particularly beneficial for Qdrant's users dealing with vast data sets or intricate geometries",
