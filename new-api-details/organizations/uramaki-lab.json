By automatically analyzing users' responses from video and audio files, the tool classifies and sorts answers based on their sentiment polarity. It processes both complete files and segmented audio from one-sided or multi-speaker videos, providing sentiment analysis for each segment along with transcriptions and corresponding sentiments for each timestamp. This significantly reduces the workload for test moderators, enabling them to focus on key insights rather than manually sifting through extensive data. Additionally, the tool offers comprehensive statistics on users' answers—both aggregated and per individual—facilitating more informed decision-making regarding application or website improvements.",

Providing task-based transcriptions of these sessions significantly streamlines the review process. However, such transcriptions allow moderators to quickly locate and focus on relevant parts of the session, enabling them to reflect, annotate, and derive insights more effectively. Furthermore, these transcripts can be easily shared with collaborators, facilitating collective analysis and deeper understanding of user behaviors and challenges encountered during the session.",
