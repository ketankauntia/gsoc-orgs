I will start with an executable binary for a basic Hello World program, and incrementally add support for linking to shared system and user libraries. Time permitting, I will work with my mentors to enable support and/or work arounds to enable linking to C and other languages.</p>\n<p>My approach will be similar to how the .NET Core creates self-contained and framework dependent deployment binaries. I have chosen this as a model as it has proven capable of running on Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems. While my work may focus initially on either Windows and the Portable Executable (PE) or Linux and Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), this approach will hopefully ensure a path forward that will eventually be capable of producing executable binaries on all popular modern operating systems.</p>\n<p>The basic method which the .NET Core uses to create executable binaries is by creating a manifest of information in the operating system dependent executable binary format which is linked to .NET’s runtime library, and handed to a .NET “main” function which executes the user program.</p>\n",
