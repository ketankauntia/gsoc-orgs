Loklak’s API can be used to build twitter clones and client alike, one of them being loklak.net. One of the main features that’s pending in such a tool is the ease of adding angular micro services and modularizing the existing application to run on micro services. Alongside the data store of loklak is magnificent and provides the ability to build IoT platforms using the loklak server.

The sensor plug-ins developed during GSoC-2015 project will be used for designing new low-cost  experimental set-ups.</p>\n<p>The new development  that will be undertaken is adding wireless node module for accessing sensors with PSL. This will enable PSL to fetch data from various sensors wirelessly and it will be useful in many experiments involving oscillatory and rotatory motions.\nDevelopment of  low cost modules for characterization in Physics research for example -  study of  sound and light absorption,  measurement  of  thermal conductivity etc, is yet another important feature of this project.</p>\n",

It starts with discussing various aspects of the project and defining its goals. Then it focusses on project implementation, the software lifecycle to be used and the modules in which the system can be divided into. Subsequently, it states application’s ideology and thoroughly explains each module (along with wireframes). It also presents a timeline of the entire project.

This would prevent  loss of requests from the user and enable the creation of event for every request and provide a web-service for direct generation of event sites from the orga-server(eventyay). In the present implementation, we have transformed websites generated through open-event-webapp to be <strong>Progressive Web App(PWA)</strong>, due to which service workers are already enabled. Therefore we can now move to further enhancement like push-notifications of bookmarked events by any user, also we need to improve the user interface for the <strong>dark theme</strong> enabled recently to project. The present testing suite requires some more tests for the functionalities like direct linking of tracks and rooms so the aim is to write <strong>mocha unit tests</strong> with selenium webdriver for the recently added features and the proposed ones. The travis build for the selenium tests run for around 20 minutes, which is quite large so the aim is to <strong>parallelize the build</strong> so that multiple builds can be performed at the same time and runtime can be decreased significantly.</p>\n",

At the core of the app, we will still use the PSLab-python library for device communication. As Electron apps are developed using JS, we can expect a more enthusiastic developer crowd to join the cause. A much more thorough documentation for the same is also available. Making use of Electron will also allow us to cherry pick modern looking UI libraries to give our user base a much more fluid experience. Finally I would make use of the easy to use packaging system of Electron so that users can easily install PSLab desktop with a single click instead of using the current install scripts.</p>\n",

This proposal aims to address these issues by updating the oscilloscope module with advanced features and integrating support for additional instruments. The existing oscilloscope feature in the PSLab Android app lacks certain functionalities crucial for comprehensive data analysis, hindering users' ability to conduct precise experiments or measurements. Furthermore, the absence of support for new instruments limits the versatility of the app. To solve these challenges, a two-fold approach is proposed. Firstly, the oscilloscope will be updated to enhance waveform visualization, integrate automated measurements, and implement advanced triggering options. Secondly, support for new instruments will be implemented by identifying key scientific instruments, developing drivers and interfaces for seamless integration, and enhancing the user interface. Upon project completion, the deliverables will include enhanced oscilloscope functionality integration, smooth operation across all oscilloscope channels, implementation and calibration of designated sensors, integration and operation of other I2C compatible sensors, and comprehensive unit testing for all newly implemented features.",

This project aims to rebuild the existing Android app using Flutter, enabling support for Android, iOS, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and web, all from a single codebase. Flutter’s flexibility and performance make it an ideal choice for this cross-platform transformation, ensuring a smooth user experience across all device types and screen sizes.\n\nAnother crucial part of this project is enhancing the hardware communication layer to accommodate platform-specific constraints—particularly Apple’s restrictions on USB communication. To address this, the project will implement Wi-Fi-based connectivity using the ESP01 chip, allowing seamless data transfer between the app and the PSLab hardware across all platforms. This ensures that iOS and web users are no longer at a disadvantage and can fully utilize the PSLab instruments.\n\nBy the end of the project, the app will offer a robust, real-time interface for core instruments like the Oscilloscope, Logic Analyzer, Multimeter, and Robot Controls, complete with interactive visualizations.",

The application empowers users to create intricate badge designs with a highly customizable interface tailored specifically for ePaper screens, supporting tri-color rendering (red, white, black) and precise editing controls.\n\nKey features include a custom drawing canvas with gesture-based freehand and line drawing tools, a text overlay system with support for font selection, scaling, rotation, and locking, and an image import module allowing for multi-image manipulation on the canvas. A layer manager provides real-time reordering of image and text overlays, mirroring professional design software like Photoshop.\n\nA polished preview and export pipeline ensures clean final renders. Users can crop and adjust the final image with brightness and contrast controls before exporting it at the badge’s native resolution (240x416). The result is optimized for both BWR and BW UC8252 display variants.\n\nThe project also includes robust NFC integration. I resolved critical issues in the original codebase, such as improper handling when NFC was disabled. I implemented a native Android method that navigates directly to the system’s NFC settings screen, significantly improving UX and cross-device reliability. The app now ensures seamless transmission of finalized designs to the ePaper badge over NFC.\n\nBy implementing all functionality from scratch, this project delivers a performance-optimized, extensible editor tailored for the Magic ePaper Badge ecosystem, advancing FOSSASIA’s vision of accessible, user-driven customization tools.",
