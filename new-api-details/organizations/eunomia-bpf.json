Building upon previous efforts, we propose to develop a unified interface that abstracts the io_uring and eBPF interactions for SSD and NIC operations. Our solution seeks to live-patch ClickHouse I/O subsystems with io_uring methods and attach BPF programs at the edge of I/O operations with BPFTime to collect metrics and optimize performance in real-time.",

With bpftime, now you may be able to run bcc and bpftrace tools on macOS and other OSs!\n\nObjectives for enable eBPF on macOS\nCompatibility and Integration: Achieve compatibility of bpftime with macOS and/or other OSs, ensuring that core features and capabilities are functional on this platform.\nPerformance Optimization: Fine-tune the performance of bpftime on macOS and/or other OSs, focusing on optimizing the LLVM JIT and the lightweight JIT for x86 specifically for macOS architecture.\nSeamless Integration with macOS Ecosystem: Ensure that bpftime integrates smoothly with macOS and/or other OSs environments, providing a native and efficient development experience for eBPF users.\nDocumentation and Tutorials: Develop documentation and tutorials tailored to macOS users, facilitating easy adoption and use of bpftime on this platform.\nExpected Outcomes\nA functional port of bpftime for macOS and/or other OSs, with core features operational.\nYou should be able to run bpftrace and bcc tools on them, and get expected output.\ndocumentation and guides for using bpftime on macOS and/or other OSs.",
