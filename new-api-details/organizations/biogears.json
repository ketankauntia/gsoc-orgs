In this process there is a need to remove the whole dependency of Java from the website and convert that to the Python based format for accessing them in the website and to support publication quality plots with high resolution.</p>\n",

Two of the high-level BioGears objectives are lowering the barrier to create medical training content and training the military. I believe that a clinically relevant comprehensive model of the naloxone reversal of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression could serve both as a training tool for emergency medical personnel as well as a predictive tool for the dose and frequency of nasally administered naloxone. Current guidelines for nasal naloxone usage are ambiguous and dependent on a wait-and-see approach instead of a high-fidelity data-driven predictive model, which risks under-usage of the life-saving drug due to basic human error.</p>\n",
