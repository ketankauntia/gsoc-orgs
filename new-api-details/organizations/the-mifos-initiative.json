To reduce the amount of human intervention in surveying for more accurate and quicker results, I have submitted a proposal in which I plan to make an Android application which will use Machine Learning, Computer Vision through the Google Cloud Vision API and Tensorflow library to perform image analysis and aid the surveying process. The app will render the relevant PPI using the Apache-Fineract SPM API. Further, images may be uploaded to the Cloud Vision Models or fed to the embedded Tensorflow models which are made available using Firebase ML Kit to obtain a report of various objects detected and inferences derived relevant to PPI questionnaire.</p>\n",

Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. \n\nGoal: \n\nIntegrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub.\n\nProject Impact:\n\nCurrently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts:\n- Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access.\n- Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. \n- Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.\n\nDeliverables: \n\nThe deliverables are divided into three main tasks, namely,\n- Token Introspection\n- Scope Check\n- OAuth MTLS",

Providing the user 24/7 customer chat support using RocketChat\n3. Integrating external payment system, Mojaloop via the Payment Hub. \n4. Covering all the screens with UI tests using Espresso. \nThe proposed enhancements to Mifos Mobile application are expected to have a significant positive impact on the user experience. By replacing the existing API layer with Open Banking APIs, clients will be able to enjoy seamless and more secure transactions. The provision of round-the-clock customer chat support through RocketChat will ensure that users receive prompt assistance whenever they require it. Integration of Mojaloop through the Payment Hub will enhance the application's payment capabilities, and it's reach.

This will streamline the process and improve model performance.\n\nAdditionally, fine-tuning a rule-based system will involve adjusting and normalizing feature weights, alongside providing users with tailored recommendations based on our analysis. Another key objective is the integration of new datasets. Currently, each dataset requires different handling, and by incorporating a new dataset, we aim to deliver more refined insights.\n\nTo address data imbalance, techniques such as minority class upsampling and additional data generation methods will be applied. This ensures the model can better handle unbalanced data distributions. Fraud detection is also a critical focus, with plans to identify suitable datasets and initiate the development of robust fraud detection capabilities.\n\nLastly, improvements in federated learning will be made to ensure data privacy and efficiency, allowing the model to learn from decentralized data without compromising individual data security.",

Originating as a Google Summer of Code initiative from 2017-2023, the project delivered the initial mobile wallet framework, evolving into a sophisticated reference application with two primary apps: PixieCollect and MifosPay, later consolidating focus on MifosPay. The developmental trajectory of the project saw significant milestones: integration with Mojaloop transaction flows, user experience enhancements, support for Kotlin, and implementation of standing instructions and merchant transactions.\n\nFurther advancements include integration with Fineract CN, multi-theme support, migration to Kotlin, and a transition towards a multiplatform approach using Kotlin multi-platform. The project aims, in 2024, to finalize G2P functionalities, ensuring production-readiness, improving security, and adopting modern development practices such as Jetpack Compose and leveraging Mifos' Android SDK. It underscores a commitment to evolving into a generic wallet management system through the Mifos X framework, incorporating cutting-edge features like the latest Payment Hub EE version, a new notifications framework, and a redesigned architecture to align with the Open Wallet Foundation's principles. This ambitious endeavor promises to redefine the landscape of mobile wallets, emphasizing security, extensibility, and a seamless user experience for G2P payments and beyond.",

We will break down existing flows into base-level elements and reconstruct them into modular, scalable UI components.\n\nThe deliverables will include: A set of core, reusable UI components built with Compose Multiplatform, shared design system with updated design principles and standards, Git-based repository to house the UI components and associated documentation, Sample screens and workflows implemented in a reference fintech app and documentation outlining how to integrate and update apps using the shared UI library.",
