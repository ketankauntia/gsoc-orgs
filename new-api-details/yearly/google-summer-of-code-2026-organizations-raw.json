Our direction emphasizes robotics and edge deployment: safe, memory‑efficient, low‑latency pipelines that run on constrained devices (e.g., embedded/Jetson‑class hardware). kornia-rs is gaining traction in the open-source community and is used by leading companies such as Farm-ng, Rerun.io, and Copper Robotics, who have featured the project on their platforms.",

Haiku is the spiritual successor to BeOS and it is derived from the NewOS kernel, which was authored by Travis Geiselbrecht (geist), who was formerly employed by Be Inc. — the developers of BeOS.\n\nLinux-based distributions stack up software – the Linux kernel, the X Window System, and various DEs with disparate toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt – that do not necessarily share the same guidelines and/or goals. This lack of consistency and overall vision manifests itself in increased complexity, insufficient integration, and inefficient solutions, making the use of your computer more complicated than it should actually be.\n\nInstead, Haiku has a single focus on personal computing and is driven by a unified vision for the whole OS. That, we believe, enables Haiku to provide a leaner, cleaner and more efficient system capable of providing a better user experience that is simple and uniform throughout.",

There are a wide range of applications from assessing infrastructure such as bridges and roads, locating buried utilities, mapping glaciers, finding anti-personnel landmines, to detecting tumours in the human body, and exploring the sub-surface of Mars and the Moon.\n\ngprMax is command-line-driven software written in Python with performance-critical parts written in Cython. It does not currently feature a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows it to be very flexible and scriptable software that can run in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, i.e. on supercomputers.\n\ngprMax can be run on either CPU or GPU. The CPU solver has been parallelised using OpenMP which enables it to run on multi-core CPUs. The GPU solver has been developed using the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. gprMax also features a Messaging Passing Interface (MPI) task farm, which can operate with CPU nodes or multiple GPUs.",

    "description": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

    "description": "Are you interested in contributing to a widely-used performance evaluation tool for computer networking research? ns-3 is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008.  The simulator is written in C++, with bindings for Python scripting, and uses the CMake build system.  We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and Zulip chat, but typically not other social media.",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2024 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University, Boise State University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well-separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

The software is mainly used for rapid prototyping, teaching, forensics, and in the medical field. It is possible to use it on the Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and Apple Mac OS X platforms. \n\nInVesalius main software started began their development on 2001 by Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer (CTI), in Brazil, later it was released under GNU license and more practitioners joins the organization to improve their development.\n\nAt that time, there was no medical image software in Portuguese that fulfilled the Brazilian hospitals and clinics needs. Therefore, InVesalius came as a proposal of development with the aim to be a medical software image analysis with null acquisition cost, capability of execution on low-cost personal computers and the\ncapability of execution on different operating systems and act as a platform to encourage the use and development of medical images in Brazil.",

    "description": "Graphite is an in-development raster and vector graphics editing suite that's free and open source. It is powered by a node graph compositing engine that fuses layers with nodes, bringing a generative, procedural approach to the workflows of artists, designers, and animators ranging from students and hobbyists to creative professionals and studios.\n\nThe node-based compositing engine is built similar to a game engine. It is both a real time render pipeline and a visual programming language, complete with a custom compiler letting artists export dynamic content to other applications.\n\nOver time, Graphite intends to evolve into the \"everything app\" across every major 2D creative discipline— a versatile creation suite for graphic design, photo manipulation, digital painting, motion graphics, desktop publishing, and generative art (both procedural and AI-powered).\n\nThe five-year-old project is being rapidly developed by a global team of volunteers, composed mostly of students, who are passionate about crafting high-quality code that will transform and democratize the broader 2D creative industry.\n\nThe mission of Graphite strives to unshackle the creativity of every budding artist and seasoned professional by building the best comprehensive art and design tool that's accessible to all. Mission success will come when Graphite is an industry standard. A cohesive product vision and focus on innovation over imitation is the strategy that will make that possible.",

At the core of OHC's innovation is its flagship Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, recognized as the 50th Digital Public Good by the United Nations. This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.\n\nOHC represents a unique fusion of professional expertise and community-driven innovation, primarily fueled by a small team of dedicated developers and a dynamic community of college students. This collaborative model showcases a new paradigm in healthcare technology, emphasizing impactful, sustainable, and scalable solutions.\n\nOriginally a volunteer-driven initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, OHC has continually addressed citizen-level healthcare problems. Its CARE software, adopted by several Indian states, played a crucial role in optimizing healthcare resource management during the pandemic. As the pandemic waned, CARE evolved to support the 10BedICU Project, enabling technology-driven ICU care in rural India and providing TeleICU services to the remotest regions, impacting thousands of lives.\n\nToday, beyond the 10BedICU Project, CARE is being adopted for various healthcare applications, including palliative care digitization, demonstrating its adaptability and growing significance in improving healthcare delivery across diverse settings. OHC's journey is a testament to the transformative impact of youth-driven initiatives in healthcare, touching the lives of millions across India.",

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\nThe public instance of cBioPortal (https://cbioportal.org/) is one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The three papers documenting the cBioPortal: Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012; Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013; and de Bruijn et al. Cancer Res. 2023; have been cited more than 16,000, 17,000, and 800 times, respectively. There are more than 100 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes around the globe.\n\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands.",

The UCSC OSPO creates partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the UC system in order to help students learn from open source communities, support scientists in using open source to accelerate research efforts, and connect students and scientists with sponsors from industry, government, and foundations. The OSPO helps bridge the gap between academic research and successful open source projects by promoting innovative projects maintained by UC-affiliated scientists and researchers. We support the transfer of cutting-edge technology resulting from UC-originating research to industry via successful open source projects. Due to the multi-campus nature of our current efforts, the projects we support and promote cover a wide range of topics and technologies - including:\n\n- Open Source Hardware and Chip Design\n- AI / Machine Learning\n- Storage Systems and Devices\n- Data Science and visualization\n- Scientific Computing & Research Infrastructure\n- Reproducibility\n- Cloud-based computation\nAll of our mentors are scientists and researchers who are actively involved in one or more of these open source projects.",

The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advises on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e.g. https://howto.gov.gr/ - https://forma.gov.gr/) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (https://openedtech.ellak.gr/ )",

    "description": "Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2026 is the year when AI is going to change the coding industry, and GSoC and the open-source projects on it, have to jump on.\nAt the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using many models and technologies. \nThis 2026, all the projects will have an Artificial Intelligence voice, and most of them will use of diferent AI models to handle queries and arrange data, starting from Google's Gemini and Gemma.",

The project emphasizes clear internal architecture, rigorous testing, and close alignment with the evolving ECMAScript standard.\n\nDevelopment is community-driven and spans multiple areas of language runtime engineering, including parsing, bytecode compilation, virtual machine execution, garbage collection, performance optimization, and specification conformance. Boa is actively developed and used as a platform for exploring modern JavaScript engine design in a memory-safe systems programming language.\n\nIn 2026 Boa's work has been used in browsers such as Google Chrome and Node.js to implement Temporal, you can read more about this in https://boajs.dev/blog/2025/09/24/temporal-release. Boa has also been used as an implementation to help drive standards within TC39 (the standards committee behind JavaScript).",

    "description": "LabLua is a research lab at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n\n\nWhat is Lua?\n\n\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\nWhat is Lunatik?\n\nLunatik is an extension framework for Linux that combines the approaches of Extensible Operating Systems and Scripting Languages. This approach, named Kernel Scripting, advocates that OS kernels can be dynamically extended by using a high-level scripting language. Lunatik is a programming and execution environment that offers two main features: it allows developers to make subsystems scriptable and allows users to run Lua scripts in the kernel.\n\nWhat is Pallene?\n\nPallene is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua. It is designed to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types. Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.",

    "description": "MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Welcoming documentation such as the User Guide https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/ make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than almost two thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",

    "description": "R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.\n\nR is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

    "description": "OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy, astrophysics & heliophysics projects that are used by researchers and software engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [James Webb Space telescope](https://jwst.nasa.gov/), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg., [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detecting planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy currently consists of [18 projects](https://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools, the range of which is wide. \nFor example: \n- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data, reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with access to the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis tools and visualisation code;\n- [Julia Astro](https://juliaastro.org/dev/index.html) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we strive to strengthen collaborations between each sub-organisation, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects. With the goal being unification of standards and libraries to enable true multidisciplinary research.",

    "description": "When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.\n\nIt addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.\n\nFinally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.",

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\n\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).

    "description": "Learning Equality is an education technology nonprofit focused on fostering  student-centered learning and advancing organizations working with underserved teachers and learners globally. Through community-driven innovation and strategic partnerships, we provide offline-first, open-source digital tools and implementation support to help them thrive.\nWe create and support open-source technology that directly and focally addresses the infrastructural and resource equity gaps that further marginalize learners with limited Internet. We started by enabling offline access to Khan Academy's videos and exercises and grew to become a key player in the global education technology landscape. For the past 13 years we’ve focused on boosting learning outcomes in some of the most challenging contexts, supporting disconnected learning in refugee camps, rural schools, out-of-school programs, and more.\nLearning Equality develops and maintains Kolibri, an adaptable set of open tools specially designed to support teaching and learning with tech but without the Internet for the third of the world that still lacks access to connectivity.\nKolibri is centered around an offline-first learning platform that runs on a variety of low-cost and legacy devices. It is complemented by a curricular tool, a library of open educational materials, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation. These tools are open and available in a variety of languages to better support learners and educators globally.\nAs a community-driven nonprofit, Learning Equality works closely to co-design Kolibri with a core network of collaborators, including national NGOs, UN agencies, government, and corporate partners. We also adopt a needs-based approach, constantly gathering insights from our community to inform the development of our tools.\nThrough its do-it-yourself adoption model and strategic collaborations, Learning Equality has conservatively reached  13 million  learners and educators in every country in the world. Given our offline access and distribution model, we learn about usage of Kolibri through a combination of telemetry ping backs of high level, aggregate, anonymized statistics, data from partners, and use of our Kolibri Data Portal. Since instances of Kolibri never need to connect to the Internet to be used, we do not know about usage across every instance, which is why this is an informed estimate from years of data.",

    "description": "Computational thinking for all with free visual coding apps\nThe Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 870 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.",

    "description": "webpack is THE build tool for modern web applications run on NodeJS\nwebpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\nOverview\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\n\nWhat makes webpack unique?\nExtensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\n\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\n\nUsed at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\nCommunity Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only.",

The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.\n\nLLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.",

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

    "description": "GeomScale is a research and development project that delivers open source code for state-of-the-art algorithms for problems at the intersection of data science, optimization, geometric, and statistical computing. The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration. Recent studies has shown a potential application of volesti methods in trustworthy AI, static analysis of programs and differential privacy.",

    "description": "KolibriOS is a tiny open-source graphical operating system for x86 (and compatible) architecture computers, developed and maintained by the KolibriOS Project Team. It contains a monolithic kernel that runs in 32-bit protected mode and supports full preemptive multitasking.\n\nKolibriOS is a fork of MenuetOS, written almost entirely in FASM (assembly language). However, C, Sphinx C--, C++, Free Pascal, Forth, among other high-level languages and compilers, can also be used in user application development (although FASM is preferred).\n\nThe OS features a rich set of applications that include a word processor, image viewer, graphical editor, textual web browser, and over 30 games. Full FAT12/16/32 and EXT2/3/4 support is implemented, as well as read-only support for NTFS, ISO9660 and XFS. Drivers are written for popular sound, network and graphics cards.\n\nKolibriOS is VERY light on system requirements, using as little as 1MB of disk space and 8MB RAM to run. In terms of processing power, Intel®'s original Pentium® (P5 microarchitecture) or compatible CPU is sufficient to fully enjoy KolibriOS. We strive to become the OS of choice for all older computers, and provide their owners full modern OS experience.",

    "description": "GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

Still, the success of OSM wouldn't be possible without open source software and volunteer developers. The database, website and API running on our own servers, the editing tools used by contributors to improve the map, and many of the most popular libraries and end-user applications within the OSM software ecosystem are all open source software, and developed through a community-driven process.\n\nAs our Google Summer of Code participation spans this diverse set of software projects, most of which are maintained as independent efforts under the OSM umbrella, contributors will encounter a wide range of programming languages, paradigms and use cases. We hope that we have interesting challenges to offer for any developer, no matter their background!",

Our motto is \"Build great things at any scale\".\n\nLong description:\n\nJenkins, originally founded in 2006 as \"Hudson\", is one of the leading automation servers. Jenkins' motto is \"Build great things at any scale\". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.\n\nThis year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins. We have many strategic project ideas which are important to potentially hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users.\n\nThe project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.). Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure and Remoting) and special interest groups. These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project.\n\nThe Jenkins project is a part of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).",

    "description": "The Oppia project aims to empower learners across the globe by providing access to high-quality, engaging education. We envision a world where access to high-quality education is not a privilege but a human right. \n\nThe team works on two platforms: \n\n    (a) Oppia Web, which provides an online learning tool that enables anyone to learn from effective and engaging interactive lessons (called 'explorations'), which simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor. This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation.\n\n    (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. \n\nAs a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.",

The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.",

    "description": "CERN-HSF (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

    "description": "The National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB, https://nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open-source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery. Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), WikiPathways (https://wikipathways.org/), SBML (https://sbml.org/), SBGN (https://sbgn.github.io/) and others. This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing! For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over 24,000 times per month by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our 96% success rate (https://nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don’t take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students (https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and mentors (https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab). \nFind out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB at our website (https://nrnb.org). Also refer to our GSoC page (https://nrnb.org/gsoc.html) for additional resources and application tips.",

It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference.\n\nThe language natively supports lazy evaluation, and lets you track side effects in the type system. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By controlling side effects and working with immutable data, the programmer can avoid whole classes of bugs.\n\nHaskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.\n\nIn Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):\n\n- Compilers\n- Commonly used libraries\n- Commonly used applications written in Haskell\n- Profilers, debuggers and other tools\n- Package managers and infrastructure\n\nWe have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.",

    "description": "CCExtractor Development is the creator of the de-facto captions extraction tool - CCExtractor. It is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it.\n\nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.\n\nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.\n\nIn addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: support, AI, rclone, cloud, flutter, peer-to-peer and a few more that are starting to take shape.\n\nThe best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics & technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.\n\nWe’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 9th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment. If you want to be a part of such community and help achieve our goals, come join our Slack group or mailing list!",

By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.\n\nWhen used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU.

The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.\n\nOctave is continually being upgraded.

Unlike the standard MRI methods that are daily used in hospitals, raw perfusion MRI data require further processing and quantification. This requires dedicated software tools. However, the lack of standardization and the availability of standardized and tested analysis code makes perfusion MRI less accessible and hinders its widespread use. The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) aims to address this gap and create resources for best practices in perfusion MRI including software and data inventories, code repositories, challenges, and educational material.",

    "description": "MalariaGEN is a global network of global partners who share and integrate data relevant to inform malaria surveillance, our mission is to generate insights and tools that bridge the gaps for analysts in malaria endemic settings to use their data meaningfully to inform public health efforts. We build and optimise data resources and analytical tools to run directly in the cloud. Our flagship project is the Vector Observatory, which includes whole-genome sequence data for over 30,000 mosquitoes, integrating data from 70 partners across the globe from over 17 different mosquito species -- this is the largest resource on genetic variation data for any multicellular organism (other than humans!). Our goal is to enable analysts, scientists, students and public health practitioners to access these data without the need for any dedicated compute infrastructure, by optimising our resources to run within free compute environments (a big shout to Google Colab!) and by developing training resources that support partners to get confident with using cloud-native data and resources for their analysis.",
