    "description_html": "<p>The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called \"show\" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of \"tools\", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.</p>\n",

The goal is to provide universal technology and tooling that introduces a common format for smart agreements, reducing the need to adopt and learn different technologies and future-proofing templates. Moreover, this facilitates the use of executable agreements across any infrastructure: cloud, blockchain, IoT. Furthermore, Accord Project provides domain specific functionality, meaning it is purposely designed and engineered for building and running commercial agreements, not generic applications.</p>\n",

With the Cosmic Dust Team of the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart we are simulating cometary dust particles for the IMEX project of the European Space Agency (ESA). And now with our newest umbrella team, the ep2lab of Charles III University of Madrid, we are also involved in simulating and building propulsion systems for space applications.</p>\n<p>We are a small organization but having impact within our space community by helping realizing space exploration by creativity and open access. We are open for everybody interested in space for the betterment of everybody. We believe everyone can be involved in space and making space together!</p>\n",

We like to call the Amahi servers HDAs, for \"Home Digital Assistants.\" Each HDA delivers all the functionality you would want in a home server, while being easy to use from a web browser and mobile apps.</p>\n<p>Amahi can turn popular Linux distributions into a simple to use networking, storage and app server. The server management  is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.</p>\n<p>The installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.</p>\n<p>Once the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>appleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.</p>\n<p>appleseed is actively developed by a small, international team of talented volunteers from the animation and VFX industry. Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a> (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Blender, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>appleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&amp;D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).</p>\n<p>In October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on C++), and the Arduino Software (IDE or CLI tool).</p>\n<p>Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.</p>\n<p>Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.</p>\n",

It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/users\" target=\"_blank\">companies</a>. It's downloaded more than <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core\" target=\"_blank\">8 million times a month</a> on npm.</p>\n<p>When your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.</p>\n<p>In short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.</p>\n<h5>Transition to Natively Support JavaScript</h5>\n<p>Babel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.</p>\n<p>For example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">[1, 2, 3].map(n =&gt; n + 2); // arrow functions!\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">[1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression\n  return a+2;\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Efforts like <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env</a> means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.</p>\n<p>Please read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!</p>\n",

BeagleBoard.org’s vision is to improve access to small, low-power computing platforms that can be embedded into new creations using easy to use development tools, such as its self-hosted, web-based IDE. The hardware designs of all Beagle boards are open source with all schematics, bills-of-materials, layouts, etc. shared for building other devices. The software is also open source and is generated by the community. Compiler tools are free and the board is available at a low cost. Boards will be provided for free to any student participating in a BeagleBoard.org-related GSoC project.</p>\n<p>Texas Instruments sponsors a number of BeagleBoard.org-related activities and the first members of the community were TI employees, however, the collaboration base is now stronger than ever with over 10,000 members on the mailing list, over 100,000 individual developers worldwide who have purchased Beagle hardware and over 150 developers who actively participate on the live chat (IRC channel) at any given time. Existing projects are often for the purpose of building robots, autonomous flying drones, automotive entertainment and navigation systems, home media centers, digital signs, wearable computers, gaming consoles and even 3d printers! (over 380 projects registered at <a href=\"http://beagleboard.org/project/\" target=\"_blank\">http://beagleboard.org/project/</a>) Existing software compatibility includes various versions of Android, Ubuntu, Angstrom, Gentoo, FFmpeg, XBMC, ROS, OpenCV and much more.</p>\n",

The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.</p>\n<p>Many companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like ejabberd, Riak, Phoenix, CouchDB, Zotonic, Nerves project and many more are built on top of it. Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, BarrelDB, a distributed database, LASP, a language for Distributed Eventually consistent computations, and ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others. This gives students a wide range of choices, that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.</p>\n",

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a> has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,</li>\n<li>Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Python native</h3>\n<p>If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that.</p>\n<h3>Platform native</h3>\n<p>It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.</p>\n<h3>More than just code</h3>\n<p>We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Reliable monitoring is tough and with the increase in sophistication in modern platforms, the performance of a system tends to affect on a serious note. The applications that run on these systems have the probability of a complete request-response cycle without any errors nowhere close to 1. The existing monitoring tools are tough to capture these events, even in their full potential which is obvious due to the learning curve, lack of a normal end-user based simplicity and missing out on some useful parameters.</p>\n<p>Bench-routes is a GUI-powered highly scalable monitoring tool that monitors system services, kernel information, application behaviour and performance of web applications and its routes (API). The design of the project enables it to monitor anything that can be converted to a time-series format that is ingestible by our querier. This increases flexibility and widens the scope of monitoring.</p>\n<p>Bench-routes also performs a series of networking algorithms and calculations to find the real-time state of routes in an application.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data. We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.</p>\n<p>We have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration platform; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.</p>\n",

We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.</p>\n<p>The XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.</p>\n<p>Pranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:</p>\n<p>“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”</p>\n",

Since 2011, we have completed more than 400 bioinformatics analysis projects with over 290 distinct groups of researchers across Canada. Our teams have significant experience in personalized medicine applications. These have included genome analysis and interpretation of personal genomes, technology and services to record patient presentations, RNA- and ChIP-seq data analysis, and analysis of complete human epigenomes in both germline disorders and cancers. C3G co-organizes each year several international workshop about next-generation sequencing data analysis.</p>\n<p>The  Montreal C3G node has developped <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines\" target=\"_blank\">MUGQIC pipelines</a> consist of Python framework scripts which create a list of jobs running Bash commands to analysis NGS data. Those scripts support dependencies between jobs and smart restart mechanism if some jobs fail during pipeline execution. Job commands and parameters can be modified through several configuration files.

A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.</li>\n<li>Multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What Casbin does NOT do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Authentication (aka verify username and password when a user logs in)</li>\n<li>Manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container.

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.</p>\n<h3>Who is using cBioPortal?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">public instance of cBioPortal</a> is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 1,500 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal (<a href=\"http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210\" target=\"_blank\">Gao et al. Sci.

There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notable, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by <a href=\"http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/\" target=\"_blank\">AACR GENIE</a>, an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>We are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from  <a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dana-farber.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Princess Margaret Cancer Centre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</a>, and <a href=\"http://thehyve.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands</a>.</p>\n",

If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.</p>\n<p>While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.</p>\n<p>In addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: JokerTV integration, YouTube TV/Hulu support, AI, rclone, cloud, and a few more that are starting to take shape.</p>\n<p>The best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics &amp; technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.</p>\n<p>We’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 7th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment.

CROSS turns OSS prototypes into successful open source software projects. The Center was created in 2015 inspired by the story of UCSC alumni (and CROSS benefactor) Sage Weil, who turned his research prototype Ceph into a multi-million dollar company. We draw from the expertise of our affiliated experts and industry members to choose projects that will have maximum real world impact. Our projects are mentored and guided by a team of experts chosen specifically to best ensure success.</p>\n<p>CROSS uses a combination of teaching, networking, research and incubation of open source projects.  With the support of our industry members, CROSS currently funds six open source software projects-- three research projects and three incubator projects. These projects are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skyhook: Programmable Storage for Databases (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/skyhook-programmable-storage\" target=\"_blank\">https://sites.google.com/view/skyhook-programmable-storage</a>)</li>\n<li>Tracery2 and Chancery (<a href=\"http://www.tracery.io/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tracery.io/</a>)</li>\n<li>Black Swan: The Popper Reproducibility Platform (<a href=\"http://falsifiable.us/\" target=\"_blank\">http://falsifiable.us/</a>)</li>\n<li>LGraph: Open Source Multi-Language Synthesis and Simulation Infrastructure (<a href=\"https://github.com/masc-ucsc/lgraph\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/masc-ucsc/lgraph</a>)</li>\n<li>CAvSAT: A System for Query Answering over Inconsistent Databases (<a href=\"https://github.com/uccross/cavsat\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/uccross/cavsat</a>)</li>\n<li>Eusocial Storage Devices: Quantifying the benefits of offloading to smart storage devices (<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/summer2018/kufeldt\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/summer2018/kufeldt</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>The SFT (Software for Experiments) group is part of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, <a href=\"http://www.cern.ch\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cern.ch</a>), and focuses on providing common software for its experiments. CERN is one of the world’s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (<a href=\"http://info.cern.ch\" target=\"_blank\">http://info.cern.ch</a>), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html</a>) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.</p>\n<p>The projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.</p>\n",

The HEP Software Foundation (<a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/</a>) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, <a href=\"http://www.cern.ch\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cern.ch</a>) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  <a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider</a>) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

Work in the CHAOSS Project community is largely organized around software and metrics.</p>\n<h3>Why Create CHAOSS?</h3>\n<p>The importance of open source software is no longer in question and its importance raises important questions about how we understand the health of the open source projects we rely on. Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts for the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects. In response, people want to know more about the open source projects they are engaged with. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.</li>\n<li>Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.</li>\n<li>Open source companies want to know which communities to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.</li>\n<li>Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In response to these issues, the CHAOSS project develops metrics, practices, and software for making open source project health more understandable. By building measures of open source project health, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.</p>\n<h3>What are CHAOSS Goals?</h3>\n<p>The project goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community health</li>\n<li>Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development</li>\n<li>Develop programs for the deployment of metrics not attainable through online trace data</li>\n<li>Build reproducible project health reports</li>\n</ul>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level.  For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body.  These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance.  Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Checker Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.</p>\n<p>Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count = \"hello\";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html\" target=\"_blank\">ideas list</a> for <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html#get-started\" target=\"_blank\">how to get started</a> and <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/typetools/checker-framework/master/docs/developer/gsoc-ideas.html#ask-questions\" target=\"_blank\">how to ask questions</a>.</p>\n",

Besides providing traditional network-level security, the flexibility of eBPF enables security with the context of application protocols and DNS requests/responses. Cilium is tightly integrated with Envoy and provides an extension framework based on Go.

It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).</p>\n<p>Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>\n<p>As software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>\n",

The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.</p>\n<p>Current research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.</p>\n<p>Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), JavaScript, and Microsoft’s .NET framework. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>\n<p>Clojure, as a GSoC mentoring organization, includes projects from all parts of the Clojure ecosystem, from IDE tooling to logic programming libraries.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>CloudCV is a young open source cloud platform  started in 2013 by students and faculty from Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Virginia Tech (now at Georgia Tech) with the aim to make AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>CloudCV consists of three major platforms:</p>\n<p><strong>Origami</strong> is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabrik</strong> is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.</p>\n<p><strong>EvalAI</strong> is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable &amp; accurate quantitative analysis.</p>\n",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>With coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.</p>\n<h4>For Users</h4>\n<p>coala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.</p>\n<h4>For Developers</h4>\n<p>You can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.</p>\n<h4>For Newcomers</h4>\n<p>coala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.</p>\n",

It is easy to use and very lightweight.\n\nCockpit interacts directly with the operating system from a real Linux session in a browser.\n\nCockpit makes Linux discoverable, allowing sysadmins to easily perform tasks such as starting\ncontainers, storage administration, network configuration, inspecting logs and so on.\n\nJumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.\n\nYou can also easily add other machines that have Cockpit installed and are accessible via SSH and jump between these hosts.\n\nRead more about cockpit in https://cockpit-project.org.",

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. For example, our web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell.</p>\n<p>Our technologies have broad impact in education: Traditional didactic and textbook-based learning formats utilized in many life sciences courses create an environment that limits student ability to develop highly needed technical skills and fully conceptualize the complex and dynamic nature of biology and diseases. To address these challenges, our software technologies enable students ranging from high schools to undergraduate and graduate levels to learn about biology and diseases using by building, simulating, breaking, and re-analyzing computational models of these biological systems.</p>\n<p>Other technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.</p>\n",

We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.\nOne very successful example of such innovation is OMEMO encryption, which is now supported by 5+ popular XMPP clients and was originally developed for Conversations as a GSoC project.</p>\n<p>Over time, the Conversations project also developed various tools to make life easier for end users and also make the XMPP world more approachable for new comers. For example we developed the XMPP Compliance Tester that tests public servers for compatibility with the latest XMPP extensions to help users <a href=\"https://gultsch.de/compliance_ranked.html\" target=\"_blank\">pick a good server</a>.</p>\n",

Using this tool, you can freeze a running container or individual application and checkpoint it as a collection of files on disk. You can then use the files to restore the application and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. With this feature, application live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are possible.</p>\n<p>CRIU started as a sub-project of OpenVZ and grew with tremendous help from the community. It is currently packaged for many Linux distributions and is integrated into such projects as OpenVZ, Virtuozzo, LXC/LXD, Docker runc, Podman, and other software. It's a part of a container live migration tool called p.haul that automates all the steps needed to live migrate a container with the smallest \"freeze time\" possible. For that it orchestrates the work of three core CRIU functionalities -- memory pre- and lazy- c/r, general save-restore and disk-less images transfer.</p>\n<p>An essential part of the CRIU tool is the library called \"Compel\" which lets you inject so called parasite code into a running process. This library is the base of CRIU, but is independent from it and allows doing some marvellous tricks like re-directinng IO streams for processes, doing apps live-updates, manipulating the internal state of a running application in a way more powerful manner than gdb allows, etc.</p>\n",

Our data are available publicly at <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu</a> and our audiences comprise primarily scholars and students, but with growing numbers of informal learners.</p>\n<p>At the heart of cdli is a group of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers, and cuneiform specialists who develop software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href=\"https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>D is a programming language with an emphasis on powerful metaprogramming facilities on top of a robust, efficient core. Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.</p>\n<p>Metaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, <em>compile-time evaluation</em> allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, <em>static introspection</em> allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as \"Design by Introspection\". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.</p>\n<p>D's rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole. The best, most innovative ways to use the D language are yet to be discovered.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"https://dlang.org/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">D's feature set and design at dlang.org</a></p>\n",

See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how <strong>BBC</strong> has created the <em>World Cup 2010</em> website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.</p>\n<p>Or, more recently, did you see that <strong>IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge</strong>?</p>\n<h3>DBpedia Spotlight</h3>\n<p><strong>DBpedia Spotlight</strong> is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that <em>Spotting</em>) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that <em>Disambiguation</em>). For example, <code>Washington</code> can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.</p>\n<h5>We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</h5>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>At DeepPavlov, our work contributions are spread across 3 parts of the technology stack, including Library, Dream, and Agent. All of these projects are focused on enhancing and strengthening our Conversational AI stack, with each contributing corresponding components.</p>\n<p>DeepPavlov Library is a foundation for our framework. DeepPavlov is an Open-source framework for building chatbots and virtual assistants. It comes with a set of predefined components for solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) related problems and a framework to build a modular pipeline that lets developers and NLP researchers create production-ready conversational skills. DeepPalvov Library is based on TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. It contains basic NLP components like NER, Entity Linking, KBQA, Go-Bot, and many others.</p>\n<p>DeepPavlov Agent is our multiskill Conversational AI orchestrator that coordinates the entire Conversational AI pipeline of the AI Assistants. It incorporates annotators, skills, Skill &amp; Response Selectors to provide a coherent experience to its users. It was used by our socialbots like one we've built for Amazon Alexa Prize 3 and our DREAM socialbot, by Deepy - our Open-source Multiskill AI Assistant, and is currently powering our socialbot built for Amazon Alexa Prize 4.</p>\n<p>DP Library and DP Agent make it easy for beginners and experts to create advanced dialog systems. Additionally, its declarative approach to defining sequences of model execution in config files allows users to track dependencies and provide paths to download the missing trained ML models.</p>\n<p>DeepPavlov Dream is a set of our default goal-oriented and chit-chat skills, as well as a number of demo AI Assistants built using components from Library and managed by DeepPavlov Agent.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data. We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.</p>\n",

It works as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a mailing list</li>\n<li>a discussion forum</li>\n<li>a long-form chat room</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>What’s different about it?</h5>\n<p>Discourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion platform should be today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>\n<h5>We’re civilized.</h5>\n<p>Our unique \"trust levels\" system means that the community builds a natural immune system to defend itself from trolls, bad actors, and spammers — and the most engaged community members can assist in the governance of their community. We put a trash can on every street corner with a simple, low-friction flagging system. Positive behaviors are encouraged through likes and badges. We gently, constantly educate members in a just-in-time manner on the universal rules of civilized discourse.</p>\n<h5>Uncompromisingly open source.</h5>\n<p>There is only one version of Discourse – the awesome open source version. There’s no super secret special paid commercial version with better or more complete features. Because Discourse is 100% open source, now and forever, it belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. That’s how community works.</p>\n<p>Everything that most communities would want is included out of the box; a giant collection of complex plugins should not be required to have a great experience.</p>\n<h5>Further reading:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.discourse.org/faq/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://meta.discourse.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods. It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Finite Volumes, and Finite Differences.<br>\nThe underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable different implementations of the same concept, i.e. grids or solvers,  using a common interface at a low overhead. Thus DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.</p>\n<h3>People</h3>\n<p>DUNE developers are professors, graduate students, post-docs, or people working in industry (e.g. as freelancers or consultants), currently located in Germany, UK, and Norway. With DUNE being a scientific software, they all share a scientific education and background. But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, …).</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>DUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.</p>\n<h3>DUNE's main principles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.</li>\n<li>Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.</p>\n<p>It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.</p>\n<p>The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.</p>\n<p>The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.</p>\n<p>Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.</p>\n",

ESIP’s strength comes from the depth of its partner organizations, which now number 110. Among these are all NOAA, NASA and USGS Earth observing data facilities, as well as government research laboratories, research universities, modelers, education resource providers, technology developers, nonprofits and commercial enterprises.</p>\n<p>During the last twenty years ESIP has developed significant collaboration methods and infrastructure that provide a scalable, neutral platform to support Earth science research, data and technical communities. Our partner organizations and community participants lead the advancement of Earth science information best practices in an open and transparent fashion.</p>\n<p>The Earth Science Information Partners was founded in 1998 by NASA in response to a National Research Council (NRC) review of the Earth Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The NRC called on NASA to develop a new, distributed structure that would be operated and managed by the Earth science community that would include those responsible for all elements of Earth observation, including observation and research, application and education. In 2003, ESIP incorporated as a 501(c)3.</p>\n",

The origins of the company start back in 2010, when Shay Banon wrote the first lines of Elasticsearch and open sourced it as a distributed search engine. Since then, the creators of the open source tools Kibana, Logstash, and Beats have joined the Elastic family, rounding out a product portfolio known as the Elastic Stack, which is used by millions of developers around the world.

    "description_html": "<p>Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to combine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A devotion to communication, design, and user experience.</li>\n<li>Strong theoretical foundations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples of these goals in practice include the following.</p>\n<h3>No Runtime Exceptions</h3>\n<p>Unlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants\" target=\"_blank\">friendly hints</a>. This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.</p>\n<h3>Great Performance</h3>\n<p>Elm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two\" target=\"_blank\">the benchmarks</a> show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.</p>\n<h3>Enforced Semantic Versioning</h3>\n<p>Elm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system. We use that information to force everything in <a href=\"http://package.elm-lang.org\" target=\"_blank\">our package catalog</a> to follow <a href=\"https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/#version-rules\" target=\"_blank\">semantic versioning</a> precisely. No more surprises in PATCH releases!</p>\n",

Through three core working groups EDGI analyzes changes to federal agencies' 1) funding and regulation, 2) personnel and research and 3) <strong>public data</strong>.</p>\n<p>Through the third working group, EDGI has been a leading partner in the international effort to preserve and track federal environmental data, and support environmental scientists, non-profit organizations, and foundations by making this data publicly available. We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data. We believe this work is essential to preserving the integrity of scientific research in the US, and also builds a new level of transparency and government accountability to citizens.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "Eunomia Lab is an innovative open-source organization dedicated to advancing the eBPF ecosystem. Our mission is to create and improve toolchains and runtimes that enhance the functionality and efficiency of eBPF, a revolutionary technology for running sandboxed programs within the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules.\n\nOur projects include:\n\n- bpftime: A userspace eBPF runtime. It offers rapid uprobe 10x faster than kernel uprobes, and syscall hook capabilities. It's compatible with kernel eBPF and existing eBPF toolchains, and can be injected into any running process without restart or manual recompilation. It can work with kernel eBPF or the eBPF runtime in other userspace processes.\n- Wasm-bpf: Cooprated with WaseEdge, we build the first user-space development library, toolchain, and runtime for general eBPF programs based on WebAssembly, allows lightweight Wasm sandboxes to deploy and control eBPF applications in k8s clusters.\n- GPTtrace: The first tool generates eBPF programs and traces the Linux kernel through natural language. With our AI agents, it can produce correct eBPF programs on 80%, while a baseline of GPT-4 is 30%.\n- eunomia-bpf: A tool to help developers build, distribute and run eBPF programs easier with JSON and WebAssembly OCI images\n\nOur commitment extends beyond tool development to education. We offer extensive resources for those looking to master eBPF, from beginners to advanced users. To discover more about our projects and educational materials, visit us at eunomia.dev.",

It is designed to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware/optionROM images on mainboards, network/graphics/storage controller cards, and various other programmer devices.\n\n+ Supports more than 476 flash chips, 291 chipsets, 500 mainboards, 79 PCI devices, 17 USB devices and various parallel/serial port-based programmers.\n\n+ Supports parallel, LPC, FWH and SPI flash interfaces and various chip packages (DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, TSOP40, TSOP48, BGA and more)\n\n+ No physical access needed, root access is sufficient (not needed for some programmers).\n\n+ No bootable floppy disk, bootable CD-ROM or other media needed.\n\n+ No keyboard or monitor needed. Simply reflash remotely via SSH.\n\n+ No instant reboot needed. Reflash your chip in a running system, verify it, be happy. The new firmware will be present next time you boot.\n\n+ Crossflashing and hotflashing is possible as long as the flash chips are electrically and logically compatible (same protocol). Great for recovery.\n\n+ Scriptability. Reflash a whole pool of identical machines at the same time from the command line. It is recommended to check Flashrom output and error codes.\n\n+ Speed. Flashrom is often much faster than most vendor flash tools.\n\n+ Portability. Supports DOS, Linux, FreeBSD (including Debian/kFreeBSD), NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, anything Solaris-like, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like OSes as well as GNU Hurd. Partial Windows support is available (no internal programmer support at the moment, hence no \"BIOS flashing\").",

Fortran-lang's flagship projects are the Fortran Standard Library (stdlib, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib</a>), Fortran Package Manager (fpm, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm</a>), and the Fortran website (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.org</a>). In only 14 months, stdlib has had &gt;140 pull requests merged from 23 contributors, with a total of 43 new procedures and types over 11 modules, and continues to grow. Largely modeled after Rust's Cargo, fpm is a build system and package manager dedicated to Fortran with the key goal to improve programmer happiness. Fpm is already capable of building complex Fortran projects, automatically fetching and building dependencies, and bootstrapping itself. The Fortran website provides all the latest information about Fortran compilers, libraries, and community, as well as an actively developed tutorial. Fortran-lang issues monthly newsletters that detail the relevant news and updates to the projects, and distributes them on Twitter and on its mailing list. Finally, the Fortran Discourse (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.discourse.group\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.discourse.group</a>) is a moderated and inclusive online forum for discussion and collaboration, which, since May 2020, has attracted 146 active users from all over the world.</p>\n",

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/\" title=\"FrameNet\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet</a> initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. \nFrame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is  the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h3>The Database</h3>\n<p>FN-Br implements a <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" title=\"FN-Br database\" target=\"_blank\">relational database</a> storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes data about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h3>The Applications</h3>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based annotation tool <a href=\"http://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br\" title=\"Webtool\" target=\"_blank\">Webtool</a>, a domain-specific dictionary - the <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/world-cup-dictionary/\" title=\"FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary</a>; a system for recommending tourist attractions - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/m-knob/\" title=\"m.knob\" target=\"_blank\">m.knob</a>; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/carma/\" title=\"CARMA\" target=\"_blank\">CARMA</a>.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>We are a group of developers and open hardware enthusiasts from the <a href=\"http://opencores.org/or1k/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">OpenRISC</a> community, that formed the FOSSi Foundation. It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.</p>\n<p>While our work originates from the OpenRISC processor, most of the development went into the processor ecosystem, like the toolchain, operating systems or userspace software. Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: <a href=\"http://www.librecores.org\" target=\"_blank\">LibreCores.org</a>. We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.</p>\n<p>With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few <a href=\"http://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc16-ideas.html\" target=\"_blank\">ideas</a>, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.</p>\n<p>Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Bologna, Italy, on October 7-9.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>FreeREG and FreeCEN are two projects run by Free UK Genealogy CIO (a Registered Charity in England and Wales).  Free UK Genealogy provides free access to historical data of interest to family historians and others. Over twenty years, thousands of volunteers have so far transcribed over 400 million records. The databases, search engines and user interfaces have largely largely designed and maintained by volunteers, who have been supported by a number of contractors and, more recently, a small team of support staff.  FreeREG uses mongodb, Ruby on Rails, and Refinery CMS.  FreeCEN is transitioning from mysql to mongodb, from php to Ruby on Rails, and does not have a CMS in its old interface (www.freecen.org.uk).</p>\n<p>For FreeREG, we are planning to use the summer to finish work on Version 1.5 Coordinator Enhancement - these are features which allow our volunteer coordinators to support the transcribers in their teams, and to monitor and maintain the quality of the transcription work.  We hope to have finished the tasks relating to the development of new communications systems (but there may be some bug fixing to do) and be working on improvements suggested by the coordinators.</p>\n<p>For FreeCEN, we are also  planning to use the summer to work on features for Coordinators - but this is at an earlier level.  Using our learning from FreeREG, we need to enable Coordinators to move on from outdated (and unstable) software for quality control, and undertake this using online tools. We are also beginning to explore how to offer the same functionality as www.freecen.org.uk (lots of ways to search!) on freecen2.freecen.org.uk - perhaps using AI.</p>\n",

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.</p>\n<h4>Hardware and Software</h4>\n<p>Most devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.</p>\n<h4>Common freifunk goals</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information</li>\n<li>Reducing the digital divide</li>\n<li>Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources</li>\n<li>Empowering people to build and operate their own networks</li>\n<li>Promote and support existing and new social structures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.</p>\n",

The game engine is general purpose and powerful enough for any 2D game. \nGDevelop was used for hundreds of indie games on <strong>Android, iOS</strong>, desktop (<strong>Windows/macOS/Linux</strong>) or the <strong>web</strong> (HTML5 games).</p>\n<h3>Events: making game creation intuitive for all</h3>\n<p>What makes GDevelop unique and so easy to use are the <strong>events</strong>. Events are a powerful way to express the logic of your game, without having to learn a programming language. In an event, you specify one or more conditions that are applied on the game objects. If they are fulfilled, actions are launched.\nThese events are then translated to code when the game is exported or previewed.</p>\n<p>GDevelop takes visual programming to the next step, allowing to add <em>ready-made behaviors</em> to game objects and to <em>make new behaviors</em> using these intuitive, easy to learn events.</p>\n<h3>An extensible and robust game engine</h3>\n<p>GDevelop has out of the box support for <a href=\"https://gdevelop-app.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\">physics, shaders, particles, rich text, tweens, pathfinding, a platformer engine</a>... and is bundled with 80+ examples.</p>\n<p>Extensions can be developed to enhance the game engine - all built-in features are provided by extensions. Users and developers can make extensions using <strong>JavaScript</strong> or using the <strong>visual \nevents</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game engine and the editors are based on <strong>WebGL</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> (Pixi.js, React.js for the editor interface) and <strong>WebAssembly</strong> (some parts are implemented in C++). It's easy to <a href=\"https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">start developing on the editor or extensions</a> in a few minutes!</p>\n<h3>Documentation and wiki</h3>\n<p>GDevelop is fully documented, with <strong>help pages</strong> and <strong>tutorials</strong> on <a href=\"http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/start\" target=\"_blank\">the wiki</a> (including one written during Google Season of Docs!).</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome, in 2001, to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.</p>\n",

These collaborations are often based on industry trends that require collaborative development of solutions for increased functionality in automobiles.  GENIVI has become a community where ecosystems outside of the automotive industry can meet and leverage the global automaker and supplier network in the GENIVI membership.</p>\n<p>GENIVI is accelerating innovation within the automotive ecosystem and driving initiatives founded on leading trends including system on a chip (SOC) consolidation, advanced user interfaces, software-over-the-air (SOTA), car-to-cloud connectivity and entertainment in autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>An example of automotive trends meeting open technology is the GENIVI Vehicle Domain Interaction Strategy. GENIVI, in collaboration with other global technology providers, is developing open standard interfaces and code that bridge multiple car software domains.</p>\n<p>GENIVI has also delivered multiple software components that have been adopted and deployed in production vehicles worldwide.  Developed by GENIVI, several standard interfaces (APIs) have been adopted in many commercial and open source solutions.  These software components and interfaces are combined into a buildable baseline (based on Yocto Project’s meta-ivi layer) as well.  This baseline is the basis of the GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) that is an open source, automotive development platform where prototypes and innovative IVI and connected vehicle solutions can be rapidly developed and tested.</p>\n",

Over the past 2 years, MGnify (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.</li>\n<li>The Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and its sibling project the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) are jointly responsible for defining the official names of genes in human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, horse, macaque, cat and pig. This official nomenclature ensures that studies and results on the same gene can easily be aggregated. </li>\n<li>The Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) Catalog collects all available common disease studies across cohorts of patients. These datasets allow researchers to correlate genotype to phenotype and better understand the mechanisms underlying disease as well as the role of individual human genes.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the rapid pace of generation of genomics and sequencing data, we support a fast-evolving software stack, and are constantly investigating new solutions for data storage, processing, distribution and display. We have a large compute cluster and deep knowledge of HCP, as well as access to both our own Embassy Cloud and other cloud providers</p>\n",

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>\n<p>Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "GeomScale is a research and development project that delivers open source code for state-of-the-art algorithms for problems at the intersection of data science, optimization, geometric, and statistical computing. The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration. Recent studies has shown a potential application of volesti methods in trustworthy AI, static analysis of programs and differential privacy.",

    "description_html": "<p>GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver, written in C++, that is able to work either from raw signal samples stored in a file, or in real-time with a radio-frequency front-end as signal source, and performs all the signal processing until the observable computation and Position-Velocity-Time solution.  Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.</p>\n<p>The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as <a href=\"http://www.gpstk.org\" target=\"_blank\">GPSTk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.rtklib.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RTKLIB</a>).</p>\n",

Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more. You probably use it: Mailman is used to manage many project mailing lists from 3-person teams to some of the biggest corporate support operations.</p>\n<h3>How is the code organized?</h3>\n<p>In Mailman 3, we've divided up the code into a number of sub-projects. We refer to the whole package as \"Mailman Suite\" and there's a few really important pieces you should know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mailman Core - This is the part that actually sends and receives mail and handles subscriber and list information.</li>\n<li>Postorius - A web interface for managing Mailman lists (e.g. subscribing, changing preferences)</li>\n<li>Hyperkitty - A web interface to access GNU Mailman v3 archives. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also a number of smaller projects that provide the glue to make these pieces work well together, or allow them to be used separately.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>Mailman is a community of developers and users who support people who support people! We're proud to be part of the infrastructure of the Internet.</p>\n",

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.</p>\n<p>In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!</p>\n<p>You can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.</p>\n<p>GNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.</p>\n",

The aim here is to avoid the situation today where game developers tolerate and work around driver bugs, due to the difficulty of identifying the root cause of a problem and isolating a stand-alone repro test.</p>\n",

It uses Yee's algorithm to solve Maxwell’s equations in 3D using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method.\n\nIt is designed for simulating Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and is used to model electromagnetic wave propagation in fields such as engineering, geophysics, archaeology, and medicine. There are a wide range of applications from assessing infrastructure such as bridges and roads, locating buried utilities, mapping glaciers, finding anti-personnel landmines, to detecting tumours in the human body, and exploring the sub-surface of Mars and the Moon.\n\ngprMax is command-line-driven software written in Python with performance-critical parts written in Cython. It does not currently feature a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows it to be very flexible and scriptable software that can run in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, i.e. on supercomputers.\n\ngprMax can be run on either CPU or GPU. The CPU solver has been parallelised using OpenMP which enables it to run on multi-core CPUs. The GPU solver has been developed using the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. gprMax also features a Messaging Passing Interface (MPI) task farm, which can operate with CPU nodes or multiple GPUs.",

It is powered by a node graph compositing engine that fuses layers with nodes, bringing a generative, procedural approach to the workflows of artists, designers, and animators ranging from students and hobbyists to creative professionals and studios.\n\nThe node-based compositing engine is built similar to a game engine. It is both a real time render pipeline and a visual programming language, complete with a custom compiler letting artists export dynamic content to other applications.\n\nOver time, Graphite intends to evolve into the \"everything app\" across all the common 2D creative disciplines— a versatile creation suite for graphic design, photo manipulation, digital painting, motion graphics, desktop publishing, and generative art (both procedural and AI-powered).\n\nThe four-year-old project is being rapidly developed by a global team of volunteers, composed mostly of students, who are passionate about crafting high-quality code that will transform and democratize the broader 2D creative industry.\n\nThe mission of Graphite strives to unshackle the creativity of every budding artist and seasoned professional by building the best comprehensive art and design tool that's accessible to all. Mission success will come when Graphite is an industry standard. A cohesive product vision and focus on innovation over imitation is the strategy that will make that possible.",

It is a client-server system: The client provides a platform independent web interface written in JavaScript. The server offers access to specialized algorithms written in Java via a REST interface. The aim of the project is to provide various tools for electric vehicles. There are two sides to the project:</p>\n<h4>For Drivers</h4>\n<p>On one side, we want to provide drivers of electric vehicles with practical solutions, that is, with optimal driving direction for their route. For that we are developing a platform independent navigation system.</p>\n<h4>For Scientists</h4>\n<p>On the other side, we want to develop tools for scientifically analyzing algorithmic solutions. For that we are developing tools for visualization of algorithms, for comparing their performance, we want to provide a generic API for custom algorithms and a lot more.</p>\n<h4>Ideas</h4>\n<p>Instead of working towards a specific electric vehicel, we want to leverage machine learning to derive the parameters automatically, getting better with every route.</p>\n",

Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Halide is a language and compiler focused on efficiently expressing and compiling array computation for image processing, computer vision, scientific computation, and machine learning. It provides a concise syntax and powerful code optimizations to achieve both ease of use and high performance. It also provides automatic gradient generation features for machine learning and optimization applications. Halide is used for code generation for several commercial applications including Youtube, Google Pixel, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>\n<p>The central idea of Halide is to decouple the algorithm (\"what\" we want to compute) and schedule (\"how\" are we going to compute it). The algorithm defines the high-level semantics of the program, and the schedule defines the lower-level computation details such as parallelism, order, or storage. The users would define the two separately and explore different ways to accelerate an algorithm. By following this philosophy, we have been able to generate fast Fourier transform code that is faster than fftw, and depthwise separable convolution code that is faster than TensorFlow.</p>\n<p>See Alex Reinking's cppcon talk for an introduction to Halide: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A</a></p>\n",

Coordinated by the Global Infrastructures Research Group at Department of Informatics of the University of Oslo, the network has since 1994 been involved in many countries in the \"Global South\". At the core of the programme is the development of the open source DHIS software and the use of this application to strengthen country health information systems. The DHIS 2 software is used in more than 45 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the South Pacific, and countries that have adopted DHIS 2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and organizations are starting up new deployments. We are involved in multi-disciplinary research with a focus on action-research with 7 professors, about 35 active PhD students, many masters students and many software developers from different implementing organizations worldwide. The focus for the Summer of Code is the development of DHIS2.</p>\n<p>We work so that low-resources in poor &amp; middle-income countries are available at the right places, at the right time and information from different programs, information systems can be brought together for better management</p>\n",

We bring together a passionate community of developers and a growing base of commercial participants (Delphix, Joyent, Nexenta, OmniTI, and others).</p>\n<p>illumos is the successor to Sun Microsystems' OpenSolaris project. Our culture draws heavily on the qualities that distinguished Sun engineering culture: systems engineering (component, interaction, and interface design with a strong commitment to minimalism), architectural coherence (design cooperation across subsystems), measurement-driven development (strong visibility tools, mature methodologies for their use, embedding both thoroughly in the development process). We have adapted it to work beyond the framework of a single corporate entity via federated efforts of individuals and companies with distinct interests in the technology (cloud infrastructure, storage systems, application servers, and others), sharing an interest in commodity hardware and production-driven innovation.</p>\n<p>illumos features an unparalleled combination of technologies, including the resilient ZFS storage system, production-safe dynamic tracing (DTrace), FMA predictive self-healing, the Service Management Framework for persistent process and boot management, zones for lightweight isolation and virtualisation, the KVM hypervisor for full system virtualisation, Crossbow for virtualised networks, a high-performance kernel CIFS/SMB client and server, boot environments for safe upgrades, and the MDB kernel and application debugger. All of these subsystems are actively developed by the illumos project. Both ZFS and DTrace have been ported beyond illumos (notably to FreeBSD, OS X, and Linux), where our community and sister OpenZFS community have taken a leading role in coordinating new feature development across platforms, serving as a reference platform and repository</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p><strong>Description of the code</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.sofa-framework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SOFA</a> is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>soft and rigid body dynamics,</li>\n<li>heat transfer,</li>\n<li>robotics</li>\n<li>and visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse</strong>\nThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library <a href=\"http://physiology.kitware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse</a> platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Emscriptening Sofa</strong>\nWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Communication protocols in SOFA</strong>\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation</a></p>\n",

For Google Summer of Code it acts as an umbrella organization for the research group “Visual Software Analytics” which started Getaviz in 2018. \nOur research group consists of five permanent members, who will be mentors for GSoC.  We deal with the question of how the software development process can be improved. Through visualizations we make the abstract problems of software development more understandable and accessible. In recent years, we have built up a great deal of knowledge in this field and published at international scientific conferences together with scientists from all over the world. Since last year, we have concentrated to put scientific findings into practice. Our innovative open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/getaviz/Getaviz\" target=\"_blank\">Getaviz</a> transfers the knowledge of the scientific community of software visualization into helpful tools for software developers. With the support of our growing community we are designing visualizations for exploring the structure, behavior, and evolution of software artifacts in 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and augmented reality. We provide a highly creative environment with many modern technologies on transition between science and industry.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>The Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI) at the University of Bremen, Germany, headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, investigates methods for cognition-enabled robot control. The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h3>What is InterMine?</h3>\n<p>InterMine integrates data from different biological sources, providing a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our <a href=\"http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries\" target=\"_blank\">client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript</a>.</p>\n<h4>What technologies do we use?</h4>\n<p>InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.</p>\n<h4>What sort of data does InterMine have?</h4>\n<p>Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the <a href=\"http://registry.intermine.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InterMine Registry</a> to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.</p>\n<h4>What kind of problems does InterMine solve?</h4>\n<p>Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.</p>\n",

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>\n<p>The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.</p>\n<p>Beside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. More over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

ISC provides the same leadership both in standards development and software for the DHCP protocol: <strong>ISC DHCP</strong> and <strong>Kea</strong>. Over the years, the ISC team has written over <a href=\"https://www.isc.org/community/rfcs/isc-rfcs/\" target=\"_blank\">60 RFCs</a>; we are proud of our substantial contributions to the <a href=\"http://ietf.org\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>.</p>\n<p>Administrators adopting Kea are looking for new ways to manage their core network services. They are attracted by Kea's separation of lease data from network communications, that facilitates centralized provisioning. They want to leverage Kea's hooks api and REST api to integrate DHCP with other network operations. As the explosion of containerized applications is breaking the old 1:1 relationship of IP addresses to machines, they need more flexibility and automation for services like DNS updating. The Kea team are looking for contributors who want to help us bring this core network management service into the 21st century by improving and extending the monitoring, provisioning, extensibility and performance.</p>\n<p>ISC is a non-profit company. Our open source software is freely available on our website and on <a href=\"github\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/isc-projects</a>. ISC work is supported by the sale of software support contracts, and by donations from users who want to see free open source maintained and extended for everyone.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries, which provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. They have been written in C++, Python or JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Main JdeRobot features</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ROS friendly (full compatible with ROS-Melodic)</li>\n<li>C++, Python, JavaScript</li>\n<li>Open source</li>\n<li>Easy installation from debian, PIP, npm or ROS packages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our community mainly works on six development areas:\n1.- Education in Robotics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academy: a ROS-based framework to learn robotics and computer vision with drones, autonomous cars....

But graph theory is a fertile and expansive field, so there's always more to do!  By contributing to JGraphT, you'll be powering the projects of many academic researchers and industry developers now and in the future, and gaining real-world development experience for yourself.</p>\n<h3>What's Involved</h3>\n<p>Most of the projects on our ideas list are algorithm implementations or improvements.

At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio / video calls con the desktop.</p>\n<p>The Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects:</p>\n<p>Jitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/meet\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/meet</a>)</p>\n<p>Jitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/videobridge\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/videobridge</a>)</p>\n<p>Jitsi (desktop) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP/Jabber, AIM/ICQ, Yahoo!, and Bonjour. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others.</p>\n<p>libjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/libjitsi\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/libjitsi</a>)</p>\n<p>ice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (<a href=\"http://ice4j.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://ice4j.org</a>)</p>\n<p>Together with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.</p>\n<p>The development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (<a href=\"http://www.unistra.fr\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.unistra.fr</a>) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (<a href=\"http://osgi.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://osgi.org</a>) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.</p>\n",

It can sync with OneDrive, NextCloud, Dropbox, or WebDAV. It supports standard Markdown, enhanced with optional extensions, such as to-do lists, math expressions, advanced tables, etc. You can also add tags to be able to sort your notes easily and search for them when needed.</p>\n<p>Similar to Evernote, it offers a web clipper browser extension to directly take a screenshot or save webpages directly to a notebook. Both Firefox and Chrome are supported.</p>\n<p>Joplin has gained a lot of attention over the course of the last few years. Among others, <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/5-evernote-alternatives-linux/\" target=\"_blank\">It’s FOSS</a> ranked it as the #1 note-taking app. The app, with its focus on user privacy, is also <a href=\"https://www.privacytools.io/software/notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">the first recommendation on PrivacyTools</a> for Digital Notebooks.</p>\n<p>Joplin successful participated in the Hacktoberfest in <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/hacktoberfest-22447274\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a> and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/31221846\" target=\"_blank\">2019</a> and its successful very first application at <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6331892753760256/\" target=\"_blank\">GSoC in 2020</a> is showing that Joplin is continuously raising attention in the open-source community.</p>\n<p>The user range is increasing steadily and is expected to increase further as a new desktop and mobile features are being added. This is now simplified by its new plugin system.\nNew collaboration features are being developed, in particular, the late last year released server app.</p>\n<p>This application shall give it another push to satisfy some of the most desired wishes of the community and win more long-time code contributors. As it spans across diverse modern but well-established technologies, students will encounter a diverse range of programming languages, paradigms and use cases. Moreover, they will get in touch with characters all over the globe, with different demands and priorities, as in their future professional careers. There are interesting challenges to offer for any developer.</p>\n",

Kapitan introduces the notion of an inventory which contains all your (environment or code) variables. Based on those variables you can then build your infrastructure conditionally to fit every kind of environment or code you want to deploy. If you like tinkering with your linux shell configurations or use ansible, puppet or chef to manage deployments you will enjoy the power of Kapitan.</p>\n",

Kiwix runs on most platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux) and is, of course, free to use.</p>\n<p>The software passed the million direct downloads mark at the end of 2016, 80% of these users being in the Global South. Kiwix is also used by a host of organizations around the world, be it in rural schools of Western and Southern Africa or education and rehabilitation programs in US and European prisons. There are also uses we hadn't planned for: Kiwix is for instance <a href=\"https://www.ecured.cu/EcuMóvil\" target=\"_blank\">distributed by the Cuban government</a> to help people save on data costs, or by NGOs in North Korea trying to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/\" target=\"_blank\">smuggle uncensored information</a> into the hermit kingdom.</p>\n<p>We have recently started releasing \"custom apps\"; that is, Android apps that are based on the Kiwix engine but offer only a specific piece of content. A good example is WikiMed, an application that offers medical content from Wikipedia in 10 languages: again, it is particularly popular in the Global South (India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iraq and Egypt, but to name a few of our larger user bases).</p>\n",

Originally founded in 2018 and officially registered as non-profit in 2023, Kornia AI is supported by an international community of contributors who drive its projects forward. The organization was initially built around Kornia, a widely adopted Python library for Differentiable Computer Vision, which has grown to over 2 million downloads per month and has been cited more than 400 times in Google Scholar.\n\nIn recent years, the core maintainers have shifted their focus to developing kornia-rs, a Rust-based variant designed for high-performance 3D computer vision applications. This native Rust implementation is optimized for industries that demand safety and memory efficiency, such as robotics, automotive, aerospace, and agtech. kornia-rs has gained significant traction in the open-source community and has been adopted by leading companies, including Farm-ng, Inc., Rerun.io, and Copper Robotics, which have featured the project on their platforms.",

    "description_html": "LabLua is a research lab at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n\n\nWhat is Lua?\n\n\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\nWhat is Lunatik?\n\nLunatik is an extension framework for Linux that combines the approaches of Extensible Operating Systems and Scripting Languages. This approach, named Kernel Scripting, advocates that OS kernels can be dynamically extended by using a high-level scripting language. Lunatik is a programming and execution environment that offers two main features: it allows developers to make subsystems scriptable and allows users to run Lua scripts in the kernel.\n\nWhat is Pallene?\n\nPallene is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua. It is designed to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types. Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.",

For example, what could be wrong about \"Thursday, 27 June 2017\"? Well, 27 June 2017 was not on a Thursday, and LanguageTool detects that.</p>\n<p>LanguageTool supports more than 20 languages (to a different degree), including English, Russian, German, Polish, Spanish, and French.</p>\n<h5>How</h5>\n<p>Internally, LanguageTool uses four different approaches to find errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it scans for known error pattern with a pattern languages similar to regular expressions, but more powerful</li>\n<li>it uses Java code to find errors that are too complex for the error-pattern approach</li>\n<li>it uses statistics to find uncommon sequences of words</li>\n<li>it uses artificial intelligence to see if commonly confused words are used properly (like ad/add or cease/seize)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>The Future</h5>\n<p>Artificial intelligence will be the main approach in the future to detect text errors. We're looking for your help and ideas to apply AI to the proofreading problem, for example by using a seq2seq approach like in machine translation.</p>\n<p>LanguageTool is also an end user application, and users want LanguageTool to be integrated in the software they already use. We're looking for integrations into tinyMCE, CKEditor, and many others (your suggestions are welcome). Plus, the existing browser add-on for Firefox and Chrome needs major UI improvements.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>LEAP is a dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.</p>\n<p>On the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.</p>\n<p>The LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.</p>\n",

It is complemented by a curricular tool, a library of open educational materials, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation. These tools are open and available in a variety of languages, to better support learners and educators globally.\nAs a community-driven nonprofit, Learning Equality works closely to co-design Kolibri with a core network of collaborators, including national NGOs, UN agencies, government, and corporate partners. We also adopt a needs-based approach, constantly gathering insights from our community to inform the development of our tools. \nThrough its do-it-yourself adoption model and strategic collaborations, Kolibri has reached learners and educators in more than 220 countries and territories since its launch in 2017.\n\nGiven our offline access and distribution model, we learn about usage of Kolibri through a combination of telemetry ping backs of high level, aggregate, anonymized statistics, data from partners, and use of our Kolibri Data Portal. Since instances of Kolibri never need to connect to the Internet to be used, we do not know about usage across every instance, which is why this is an informed estimate from years of data.",

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices, algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.</p>\n<p>To address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.</p>\n",

An open-source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station accessible on the web for all the network users. A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 400 stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and tested globally by University satellite teams, organizations, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.\nFurthermore, the Polaris project can be used to provide insights on satellite telemetry collected by SatNOGS using machine learning technics.</p>\n<p>Libre Space, recently delivered two open-hardware and software PocketQube-class satellites Qubik 1 and Qubik 2, and an open-source hardware and software PocketQube orbital deployment system PicoBus scheduled for launch in 2021Q1 on the inaugural launch of the Firefly Alpha rocket. The Qubik satellites will perform orbital determination and identification experiments and will showcase open-source software and hardware technologies. Additionally, Libre Space, develops an open-hardware and software satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network.</p>\n<p>Libre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities. SDR Maker Space working on several open-source Software Defined Radio sub-activities to facilitate satellite communications and OpenSatCOM working on sustainable development practices for satellite communications projects.</p>\n",

We believe that space exploration should not be restricted to the hands of a few large companies and governments, but that everyone shall be able to contribute to it. Virtually every single person on the planet is fascinated by space – at LibreCube we aim to make it accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h3>What are the concepts of LibreCube?</h3>\n<p>It is great to see that a growing number of communities are forming to liberate access to space. However, the unique proposition of LibreCube are its three core pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Source: Everything we do is made available to the public as free and open source from the start. And we only use free and open source tools for our work – this way, really everyone can get involved! </li>\n<li>Free and Open Standards: We rely on proven and tested standards for our system designs, with preference for standards from the space domain. </li>\n<li>Reference Architecture: In order to make all our hardware and software parts to work together and form a system of systems, we use or define standardized interfaces to make it possible to combine and reuse elements for various applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to find out more?</h3>\n<p>Visit our website at <a href=\"https://librecube.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://librecube.org</a> to learn more about what we are currently working on and what is planned.</p>\n<h3>How to get involved?</h3>\n<p>Go to our online discussion channel to join the community and let us hear from you!</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face! \nThis year also we’ll allow the use of Cloud-based services, like Google’s models Gemini and Palm2.",

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>\n<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</li>\n<li>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.</li>\n<li>The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.</li>\n<li>The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.</li>\n<li>The MLIR subproject aims to address software fragmentation, compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers.</li>\n<li>The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.</li>\n<li>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n",

LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in <a href=\"http://luarocks.org\" target=\"_blank\">luarocks.org</a> or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.</p>\n<h3>The build system</h3>\n<p>LuaRocks also doubles as a portable build system for compiling Lua modules. It abstracts away platform differences and allows module developers using Lua or C to distribute Lua extensions that can build in any modern operating system.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI) is an umbrella organization for machine learning-related projects in science. ML4SCI brings together researchers from universities and scientific laboratories with motivated students to join existing scientific collaborations and contribute to cutting edge science projects across a wide variety of disciplines. Students work on existing problems to develop new machine learning-based approaches and produce open source code that directly contributes to solving these scientific challenges.\nPrior to 2021, some of the ML4SCI projects were part of CERN-HSF umbrella. Since then, ML4SCI has grown to encompass many projects outside of particle physics, and in 2021, ML4SCI operates as a new umbrella organization. We welcome participating machine learning projects from any area of science to take part under the ML4SCI umbrella. \nML4SCI currently includes projects from a variety of fields. For example, some of them explore the uses of machine learning for particle reconstruction and classification in high-energy physics, deep learning-based searches for dark matter in astrophysics, applications of machine learning techniques to data returned from planetary science missions, applications of quantum machine learning to science, and others.\nMachine learning ideas and approaches can be broadly applicable and transferable across the scientific domains. The goals of ML4SCI projects are to grow the open-source community in machine learning for science by addressing important scientific challenges and transferring the knowledge and tools of machine learning across the disciplines. We look forward to your applications!</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h5>What is Matrix?</h5>\n<p>Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matrix.org\" target=\"_blank\">Matrix.org</a> defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.</p>\n<h5>What is Matrix’s Mission?</h5>\n<p>Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.</p>\n<p>The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.</p>\n<h5>What does this mean for users?</h5>\n<p>The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app &amp; server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.</p>\n<h5>How is Matrix currently being used?</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lots of different clients</a> have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!</p>\n<p>Recent work on Matrix includes <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/\" target=\"_blank\">E2E encryption</a> (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">embeddable widgets</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e\" target=\"_blank\">Communities</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite\" target=\"_blank\">Dendrite</a>!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">Encrypting Matrix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/\" target=\"_blank\">The future of decentralised communication</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<p><a href=\"https://mdanalysis.org\" target=\"_blank\">MDAnalysis</a> is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists.</p>\n<p>The goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics\" target=\"_blank\">molecular dynamics</a> (MD) simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/\" target=\"_blank\">new computational tools</a>.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by  MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protein databank</a> (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis is a project written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, softmatter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited almost a thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.</p>\n",

While the digitization of news has broadly made many sorts of research newly possible, the volume of content and newer trends toward proprietary platforms have significantly increased the barriers for researchers hoping to build on the scholarly traditions of studying attention, representation, influence, and language in online news.</p>\n<p>In addition, the democratization of content authoring has significantly expanded the number of different news sources reporting about any topic or geographic area. The process of\ndiscovering which online media sources to study has become more involved; how does one identify the set of media outlets that exist and decide which are influential? Furthermore, once a set of media sources has been created, collecting their content introduces many technological difficulties.</p>\n<h3>About Media Cloud</h3>\n<p>Media Cloud is an open source data corpus and suite of web-based analytic tools that support research into open web media ecosystems across the globe. Since 2008, Media Cloud has collected a total of over 1.7 billion stories. These data are available to the public via an open source code base available <a href=\"https://github.com/mediacloud/\" target=\"_blank\">on GitHub</a>, a suite of free <a href=\"https://tools.mediacloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">web tools</a>, and an extensive <a href=\"https://mediacloud.org/support/\" target=\"_blank\">open API</a>. Media Cloud is limited by copyright restrictions from sharing the full text of news articles with external partners. Instead, we surface metadata, data about text content of the documents and URLs of documents indexed.</p>\n<p>Researchers have used Media Cloud to study:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mapping national political discourse</li>\n<li>Online mis/dis-information</li>\n<li>Media self-analysis</li>\n<li>Human rights and social justice media impact</li>\n<li>Media-based art and advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for example, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is usually error prone, time consuming and does not add any value to the final product.</p>\n<h3>Why <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core\" target=\"_blank\">MetaCall</a>?</h3>\n<p>The main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or whatever.</p>\n<p>We want to allow polyglot applications to be written in a transparent way, and allow multiple developers to work in the same project using <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/docs/README.md#2-language-support\" target=\"_blank\">different languages</a>.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>MetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>MetaCall addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python, ... or any language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages. Imagine you don't want to use CPython anymore and you want to try PyPy instead because you need performance. Write a new backend and you will only need to change the language tag <strong>\"py\"</strong> by <strong>\"pypy\"</strong> and you are done.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Microkernels are operating systems that outsource the traditional operating system functionality to ordinary user processes while providing them with mechanisms requisite for implementing it. Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility, security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too. In fact, each component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different programming language.</p>\n<p>We are the collective body representing <a href=\"http://genode.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Genode</a>, <a href=\"http://www.helenos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HelenOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/\" target=\"_blank\">GNU Hurd</a>, <a href=\"http://www.minix3.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MINIX 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.redox-os.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Redox</a> microkernel-based operating systems. Our cooperation dates back to 2012 when we first met at the <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/\" target=\"_blank\">FOSDEM</a> conference in Brussels and organized the first track (a.k.a. a devroom) entirely dedicated to microkernels and related technologies. The <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/\" target=\"_blank\">Microkernel devroom</a> has since become a de facto institutionalized feature of each FOSDEM. Now we also take part in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization in order to function as an umbrella for our respective member projects.</p>\n",

Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.</p>\n<p>As a result of this approach, mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; the handful of publications relating to mlpack demonstrate this.</p>\n<p>mlpack is developed by contributors from around the world. It is released free of charge, under the 3-clause BSD License. (Versions older than 1.0.12 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License: LGPL, version 3.)</p>\n<p>mlpack bindings for R are provided by the RcppMLPACK project.</p>\n",

MoveIt is built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS), which enables different robotic software components to easily communicate with each other. MoveIt contains implementations of a wide variety of algorithms for planning, grasping, and control that can be applied to a broad range of robotic hardware. A setup assistant makes it easy to configure any new robot for use with MoveIt.</p>\n<p>ROS and MoveIt are widely used in research and education. For example, it allows motion planning researchers to easily test algorithms on a robot, while using algorithms from perception researchers almost like a black box (and vice versa). Both ROS and MoveIt have also matured to a point that both are being widely used in industry as well.</p>\n",

In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.</p>\n<p>MuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.</p>\n<p>The team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.</p>\n<p>All members provide bug tracking support and feedback.</p>\n",

Perhaps more importantly, type annotations act as machine-checked documentation and make your code easier to understand and maintain. Mypy can scale to multi-million line codebases, while providing quick incremental checking through the mypy daemon.</p>\n<p>Mypy lets you freely mix type checked and unannotated code, making it possible to gradually migrate existing codebases to static type checking.</p>\n<h4>What is mypyc?</h4>\n<p>Mypyc is a compiler from a type annotated Python dialect to CPython C extension modules that uses mypy as the front end. It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient.</p>\n<p>It's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs. Modules compiled with mypyc can freely interact with interpreted modules. Mypyc lets you compile a few performance-sensitive modules and keep the rest of your program interpreted.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP’s requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today’s focus on where — addresses and hosts — to what — the content that users and applications care about.</p>\n<p>The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications. NDN Technical Report NDN-0001 “<a href=\"http://named-data.net/techreport/TR001ndn-proj.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Named Data Networking (NDN) Project</a>” is a slightly modified version of the NDN project proposal.</p>\n<p>The NDN project was funded by NSF in September 2010 as one of the four projects under NSF’s <a href=\"http://www.nets-fia.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Internet Architecture Program</a>.</p>\n",

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and cell-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.</p>\n<p>The NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as <a href=\"http://cytoscape.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cytoscape</a>, <a href=\"http://wikipathways.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WikiPathways</a>, <a href=\"http://sbml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SBML</a>, and <a href=\"http://cbioportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">cBioPortal</a>. <em>This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!</em> For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over <strong>16,000 times per month</strong> by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab\" target=\"_blank\">&gt;90% success rate</a> with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab\" target=\"_blank\">students</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab\" target=\"_blank\">mentors</a>.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB.

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>For blind people to use a computer, they need a screen reader which reads the text on the screen using a synthetic voice or a braille display. However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader.</p>\n<p>NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards.</p>\n<p>NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.\nMajor highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel</li>\n<li>A built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices</li>\n<li>Reporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors</li>\n<li>Support for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard</li>\n<li>Ability to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation</li>\n<li>Easy to use talking installer</li>\n<li>Support for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants</li>\n<li>Ability to run at Windows logon and other secure screens</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Object detection and recognition is the most important focus of Computer Vision. We are constantly in search of methods to have a 'detection' system as powerful as the human being. Given a random query image, we want to have a system capable of answering the questions like: What is present in the image? Is there a house in it? Is there a human in it? Where is the house located?  Questions like these which are so trivial to human beings, are extremely difficult for a computer - the same computer which is way faster than human beings in terms of sequential calculations and executions.</p>\n<h3>Objective</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The library is built with a very specific goal - to answer the fundamental problem of Computer Vision - Object Recognition and Detection.</li>\n<li>We make available to everyone the existing solution in this direction in a common, intuitive and user-friendly APIs. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why OpenDetection? </h3>\n<p>From the Computer Vision research community, there has been good solutions to very specific tasks; for example, face detection in an image, detection of human beings, or of some objects of very particular kinds (high texture/regular etc.). The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be.</p>\n<p>Thus, the purpose of this library is to contribute in this field and make available the existing solution in this direction in a common, very structured, and a very user-friendly APIs. Every detection algorithm here is as simple as calling a function, and one can fine tune the algorithm changing the configurable parameters.</p>\n<p>More idea: <a href=\"http://opendetection.com/introduction_general.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://opendetection.com/introduction_general.html</a></p>\n",

Most of it is carried out by scientists who need to tweak their tools in order to get their experiments to run, and almost none of it is shared. To reduce the need for such redundant development efforts, we created Open Ephys as a centralized hub for tool sharing. \"Ephys\" is short for \"electrophysiology,\" which is the most common technique for recording the activity of neurons. Our main focus is on making it easier for neuroscientists to acquire data from many neurons simultaneously, and the Open Ephys GUI is the open-source, modular application that makes this possible. Our GUI, which takes inspiration from audio production software such as Ableton Live, is the most widely used open-source application of its kind. We're looking for talented  students to help make the GUI more robust and user friendly.</p>\n",

At the core of OHC's innovation is its flagship Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, recognized as the 50th Digital Public Good by the United Nations. This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.\n\nOHC represents a unique fusion of professional expertise and community-driven innovation, primarily fueled by a small team of dedicated developers and a dynamic community of college students. This collaborative model showcases a new paradigm in healthcare technology, emphasizing impactful, sustainable, and scalable solutions.\n\nOriginally a volunteer-driven initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, OHC has continually addressed citizen-level healthcare problems. Its CARE software, adopted by several Indian states, played a crucial role in optimizing healthcare resource management during the pandemic. As the pandemic waned, CARE evolved to support the 10BedICU Project, enabling technology-driven ICU care in rural India and providing TeleICU services to the remotest regions, impacting thousands of lives.\n\nToday, beyond the 10BedICU Project, CARE is being adopted for various healthcare applications, including palliative care digitization, demonstrating its adaptability and growing significance in improving healthcare delivery across diverse settings. OHC's journey is a testament to the transformative impact of youth-driven initiatives in healthcare, touching the lives of millions across India.",

Alongside teacher trainings and gender-sensitive school materials, we focus primarily on developing and expanding our visual open-source programming platform “Open Roberta Lab”.</p>\n<p>As one of the leading institutes for applied AI research in Europe, Fraunhofer IAIS aims to use Open Roberta a way to get more people excited about creating new technologies. We provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for literally everybody: in 2020 alone, more than 3 million people from 120 countries programmed their robots and microcontrollers using the Blockly-based programming language \"NEPO\".</p>\n<p>The Open Roberta Lab is a web application running in every browser. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Especially in times of Corona, this simulation has proven to be of great value. A growing number of robots and microcontrollers are now available as simulations in the Lab.</p>\n<p>Open Roberta is becoming increasingly popular with a worldwide community of teachers. In addition to tutorials that can be created independently via an editor, teachers also have the ability to coordinate their classes' assignments and programs in groups.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 14 different robot plugins.  Visit them on <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org\" target=\"_blank\">lab.open-roberta.org</a>!</p>\n<p>Interested? Do good and use your skills to prepare a new generation for the digital world that they can not only use, but also shape!</p>\n",

    "description_html": "Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital medical imaging technique that assesses blood flow in tissues and thus contributes crucial information for diagnosing conditions such as stroke, tumors, and neurological disorders. Unlike the standard MRI methods that are daily used in hospitals, raw perfusion MRI data require further processing and quantification. This requires dedicated software tools. However, the lack of standardization and the availability of standardized and tested analysis code makes perfusion MRI less accessible and hinders its widespread use. The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) aims to address this gap and create resources for best practices in perfusion MRI including software and data inventories, code repositories, challenges, and educational material.",

The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see <a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf</a> ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advices on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e,g. <a href=\"https://howto.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://howto.gov.gr/</a> - <a href=\"https://forma.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://forma.gov.gr/</a>) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (<a href=\"https://openedtech.ellak.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://openedtech.ellak.gr/</a> )</p>\n",

Similar to what the well-known GnuPG software does on desktop systems, OpenKeychain primarily serves as a key management tool, but with a stronger focus on usability. Modern mobile devices allow new features like key exchange via QR or NFC, and support for secret keys stored on Yubikey devices.</p>\n<p>On its own, OpenKeychain supports encryption, decryption, signature generation, and signature verification of files and text. In addition to stand-alone use, it comes with an API which makes crypto operations available for other apps. We are actively working together with K-9 Mail to bring secure email based on the OpenPGP standard to Android.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (<a href=\"http://regenstrief.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://regenstrief.org</a>), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (<a href=\"http://pih.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://pih.org</a>), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The transformations are reproducible: they can be replayed on datasets in the same format, with updated data. The focus is on usability through a web UI, reducing the need to learn a programming or query language.</p>\n<h4> Stack</h4>\n<p>OpenRefine is built in Java (server-side) and uses a web UI (jQuery). It is easy to work on isolated parts of the code without being familiar with the entire architecture. We try to maintain good quality standards, by testing all our changes, but remain flexible and un-opiniated.</p>\n",

Leap provides a great balance between up to date and stable, hardened Free Software for your computer. Pick your desktop, configure your system and enjoy the platform of choice for Linux users, administrators and software vendors!</p>\n<h3>Tumbleweed Rolling Distribution</h3>\n<p>If you always want to have the newest Free Software you want the openSUSE <strong>Tumbleweed</strong> rolling distribution! It appeals to power users and software developers that require the latest software stacks and development environments on a stable, close to bleeding edge Linux platform. If you're living on the Free Software edge, Tumbleweed is the best choice for you!</p>\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n<p>To be able to produce two world class distributions, openSUSE develops a lot of system level tools like <a href=\"http://yast.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">YaST</a> our installation and configuration tool,  <a href=\"https://suse.github.io/Portus/\" target=\"_blank\">Portus</a> our user interface for the next gen docker registry or <a href=\"http://machinery-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Machinery</a> an application for configuration discovery, system validation and service migration. And because we believe that communication is the most important factor in Free Software we also develop a self-hosted open source solution for videoconferencing (<a href=\"https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts\" target=\"_blank\">Jangouts</a>) and an event management app tailored for free software conferences (<a href=\"https://osem.io\" target=\"_blank\">Open Source Event Manager</a>).</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>In the summer of 2008 the <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolitan City of Rome</a> decided to start a <strong>free of charge and public Wi-Fi network</strong> to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/en\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to <em>WiFi Metropolitano</em>: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.</p>\n<p> The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller\" target=\"_blank\">wifi controller</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h3>Why Oppia?</h3>\n<p>Oppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: <a href=\"https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala</a></p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven lesson creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Orcasound is an open source project that makes it easy to listen live for animals that make sounds, like the endangered orcas in Washington State (aka Southern Resident Killer Whales, or SRKWs). We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.</p>\n<p>Since a Kickstarter in mid-2017, <a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\">key members of our community</a> have built a <a href=\"http://live.orcasound.net\" target=\"_blank\">web app</a> that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, now in beta-testing, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite\" target=\"_blank\">web-app repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. While users enjoy the live “concert” they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas’ ability to communicate &amp; echolocate scarce salmon.</p>\n<p>Orcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode\" target=\"_blank\">orcanode</a> holds Python code and shell scripts that generate the live audio stream in lossy HLS or DASH format to optimize audio playback within modern browsers and lossless FLAC format for scientific analysis. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata\" target=\"_blank\">orcadata</a> houses  multiple team efforts to develop machine learning algorithms and data processing tools for bioacoustics and underwater noise pollution.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcabooth\" target=\"_blank\">orcabooth</a> shares Orcasound recordings with educational/outreach organizations. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap\" target=\"_blank\">orcamap</a> visualizes acoustic detection and classification data spatially.</li>\n</ul>\n",

It is these large problems that our work at Our World in Data focuses on.\n\nThanks to the work of thousands of researchers around the world who dedicate their lives to it, we often have a good understanding of how it is possible to make progress against the large problems we are facing. The world has the resources to do much better and reduce the suffering in the world.\n\nWe believe that a key reason why we fail to achieve the progress we are capable of is that we do not make enough use of this existing research and data: the important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases, locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers. \n\nThe goal of our work is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable.",

We can be found at www.owasp.org.</p>\n<p>OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology.

    "description_html": "<h3>Why PEcAn?</h3>\n<p>Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters. Lastly, we're moving to use software containers to make PEcAn even more light weight and easy to use as well as implementing an API to turn PEcAn into a SaaS product.</p>\n",

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.</p>\n<p>PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:</p>\n<h8>PCP Collectors</h8>\n<p>These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.</p>\n<h8>PCP Monitors</h8>\n<p>These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.</p>\n<p>The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be  executing remotely.  On  the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.</p>\n<p>Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.</p>\n",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by long standing contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Plan 9 is an operating system originally developed by many of the same people at Bell Labs who created Unix. Plan 9 demonstrates a new and often cleaner way to solve most systems problems. The system as a whole is likely to feel tantalizingly familiar to Unix users but at the same time quite foreign.</p>\n<p>In Plan 9, each process has its own name space. A process may rearrange, add to, and remove from its own name space without affecting the name spaces of unrelated processes. This includes the ability to mount a connection to a file server speaking 9P, a simple file protocol. The connection may be a network connection, a pipe, or any other file descriptor open for reading and writing with a 9P server on the other end. Customized name spaces are used heavily throughout the system, to present new resources (e.g., the window system), to import resources from another machine (e.g., the network stack), or to browse backward in time (e.g., the dump file system). For example, device drivers in Plan 9 work by exposing a 9P server, typically mounted in /dev, and can be imported from other systems, transparently.</p>\n<p>Over time, Plan 9 has given rise to a number of offshoot projects. Inferno took many of the systems-level ideas, combined them with Limbo, a new concurrent programming language, and built them into a system which could run on bare hardware or hosted on another operating system. Plan9port takes many of the user-mode libraries and utilities and enables them to run on Unix-like systems. Each of these extends the ways Plan 9's ideas can be applied to different classes of problems.</p>\n<p>In addition to these directly related projects, ideas from Plan 9 have found their way into many other operating systems and environments. The /proc filesystem in several unixes, the rfork() call in various BSD systems, the 9P interface WSL uses to talk to Linux systems, and even UTF-8 all come from Plan 9. The concurrent programming model in Go came directly from that found in Inferno's Limbo.</p>\n",

Accessibility, security and i18n are core features.</p>\n<p>We value well-tested and documented code, and use CI extensively.</p>\n<h3>Plone the community</h3>\n<p>Plone’s intellectual property and trademarks are protected by the non-profit Plone Foundation. This means that Plone’s future is not in the hands of any one person or company.</p>\n<p>The developer community is international. There is no single large firm behind Plone, instead there are many smaller consulting firms from all over the world that offer Plone and Plone-based solutions.</p>\n<p>We have a strong sense of community, and decisions are made transparent in self-organizing teams.</p>\n<p>Development is often done in \"sprints\", with people coming together but also participating remotely.</p>\n<h3>Skillsets</h3>\n<p>Since Plone is a complete product addressing many topics, the skillsets needed to work on aspects of it are also diverse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>JavaScript and toolset (grunt, AMD, etc.)</li>\n<li>Rest, API design and implementation</li>\n<li>User Interface and User Experience design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And above all, a will and ability to communicate with other people that will have other skills and languages (both programming and human).</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.</p>\n<h3>Programming Languages</h3>\n<p>Initially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.</p>\n<h3>Copy-Paste-Detector</h3>\n<p>Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>PMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>PMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.</p>\n<p>An innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.</p>\n",

It bridges the gap between polystores and hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) systems. In contrast to most existing polystore systems, Polypheny offers support for data manipulation queries. Furthermore, it features a flexible schema, supporting schema changes at runtime.\n\nPolypheny is a full database management system providing support for a rich set of data types. Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.\n\nMoreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows combining different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.\n\nPolypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.\n\nIn conjunction with the support for multimedia data and workloads, Polypheny offers a flexibility not matched by existing database systems.",

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.  An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.  There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 30 terabytes of data.<br>\nPostgreSQL has won praise from its users and industry recognition, including the Linux New Media Award for Best Database System and five time winner of the The Linux Journal Editors' Choice Award for best DBMS.</p>\n",

PRISM has been used by researchers worldwide in fields as diverse as quantum cryptography, systems biology, computer security and robotics. Development of PRISM is based at the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford, UK, but we have contributors worldwide. It has been under development for over 10 years and contains about 200K lines of code in total. The software is coded primarily in Java, including a graphical user interface written in Swing, but with various underlying libraries written in C/C++.</p>\n",

The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.</p>\n<h3>How does Probot work?</h3>\n<p>Probot is a Node.js framework based on the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Express Server framework</a>. It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the <code>WIP GitHub App</code> mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: <a href=\"https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master</a></p>\n<h3>Why apply for Probot?</h3>\n<p>You will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.</p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you :)</p>\n",

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.</p>\n<p>We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes <a href=\"http://processing.org\" target=\"_blank\">Processing (Java)</a>, <a href=\"http://p5js.org\" target=\"_blank\">p5.js (JavaScript)</a>, and <a href=\"http://py.processing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Processing.py (Python)</a>, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.</p>\n<p>The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.</p>\n<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>A citizen science project which aims to make it easy for anyone to build a low cost, robotic telescope which can be used to detect transiting exoplanets.</p>\n<p>The PANOPTES community spans the world, from the founding members in Hawaii to designers, builders and scientists in Europe, Australia, and North and South America. We’re looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements and a forum for discussions.</p>\n<p>PANOPTES occupies a unique niche in the ongoing search for exoplanets. Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt.</p>\n<p>PANOPTES is attractive because it can complement these missions, doing so cheaply and with the involvement of citizen scientists. And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more. It is the hope of the project that schools will come up with novel ways to utilize the unit and the data it gathers.</p>\n",

However, it is the Wiki community that created such a giant knowledge base. WikiLoop is an initiative to make tech people contribute back to the greater Wiki community including open knowledge institutions, academia and researchers who are interested in advancing computer-based technologies. With contributor's technical skillset and vision, typical WikiLoop projects help Wikipedia and its sister projects improve their knowledge sources and help the community by empowering humans and bootstrapping machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Tibetan Initiative: Preserving Precious Tibetan Buddhist Heritage</strong>\nOne of the targets of WikiLoop is to help knowledge institutions to preserve their precious knowledge. Tibetan language and culture is an example that could be benefited from WikiLoop.\nTibetan literature contains rich explorations of psychology, spirituality, and human experience continue to serve as a consistent source of inspiration to Western philosophy and psychology, as well as other modern sciences. There are millions of Tibetan speakers around the world. However, the Tibetan language is much underserviced in the digitized world. For example, it lacks modern NLP technologies such as machine translation, and basic NLP foundations such as tokenization. And existing efforts of knowledge preservation are isolated. So it is a good starting point for the WikiLoop project, where things could be connected to make a great impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Your GSoC Opportunity</strong>\nWe have a list of ideas targeting preserving Tibetan heritage but also could be expanded into a much larger scope by connecting other institutions and communities depending on students' preference.</p>\n",

Our collaboration and development platform PublicLab.org enables thousands of people to publish updates and share designs for emerging environmental open hardware projects.</p>\n",

In addition to core functionality for working with audio and 2d graphics, it ships with a large set of external libraries to handle video, 2D/3D graphics, sensors, input devices, and networking.</p>\n<p>Purr data has a special emphasis on generating audio and/or video in real time, with low latency. Much of its design focuses on receiving, manipulating, and delivering high-quality audio signals.  Specifically, the software addresses the problem of doing this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.</p>\n<p>Purr Data builds on code from several other software projects: Pure Data-- which is the audio and scripting engine, Pd-extended-- which is a now abandoned application that shipped Pure Data with lots of external libraries, and Pd-l2ork-- which added long-needed usability enhancements like infinite-undo and native state-saving mechanisms to Pure Data.</p>\n<p>Purr Data uses a GUI based on the nw.js toolkit. This means the entire GUI is built using HTML5 technologies, and any of those-- including thousands of web frameworks, the Gamepad API, WebGL, etc.-- may be leveraged by users and developers.</p>\n",

We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&amp;T Foundation.</p>\n<h3>Improving Education with Innovative Technology</h3>\n<p>Quill was recently featured in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers\" target=\"_blank\">Fast Company</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Machine Learning blog</a> for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers.</p>\n<p>Learners begin by completing a <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic\" target=\"_blank\">diagnostic activity</a> that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even <a href=\"https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692\" target=\"_blank\">special versions of the diagnostic</a> for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)</p>\n<p>Quill has a variety of activity types, including <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons\" target=\"_blank\">a real-time classroom lessons mode</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/connect\" target=\"_blank\">a sentence construction tool</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader\" target=\"_blank\">a proofreading practice tool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar\" target=\"_blank\">a grammar practice tool</a>.</p>\n<p>Each tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.</p>\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>\n<p>Up until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.</p>\n",

It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

    "description_html": "RADAR-base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapses) is an open source platform for remote patient monitoring. The main focus of RADAR-base is seamless integration of data streams from various wearables and mobile applications to collect patient generated data in real time and store, manage and share the collected data with researchers for retrospective analysis.\n\nRADAR-base provides both passive and active data collection. Passive collection can be done by directly sending data from phone sensors or device sensor data through the (pRMT) app or device sensor data via cloud storage to RADAR-base or combination of these options. Active data collection using the active Remote Monitoring Technologies (aRMT) app, which includes the use of questionnaires that might ask patients about their mood, medication intake, or the severity of symptoms. All of the collected data can be extracted from the platform in structured formats.\n\nRADAR-base community consists of software engineers, data scientists, researchers,operations engineers, bioinformaticians. The RADAR-base platform was build and maintained by The Hyve B.V (https://www.thehyve.nl/) and PhiDataLab (https://phidatalab.org/) at Kings College London under the IMI RADAR-CNS and IMI RADAR-AD project. \n\nCurrently, the platform has been used by many academic institutes and research organizations to conduct remote monitoring studies. \n\n\nFunding statement and Disclaimer\n\nThe RADAR-base platform was developed under projects IMI RADAR-CNS, IMI RADAR-AD, Bigdata@Heart and IMI H2O which received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement numbers 115902, 806999, 116074 and 945345 respectively. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA.

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2021, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).</p>\n",

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism. More cutting-edge software engineering technologies are being included in RoboComp to simplify the life-cycle of robotics components and to facility the deployment of very large networks of components that more a more start to resemble a \"biological\" computational device.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h4>Ruby on Rails make web application development easy and fun.</h4>\n<p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>\n<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>\n<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>\n<p>Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</p>\n<p>Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</p>\n",

SciRuby consists of a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/Ixha2p\" target=\"_blank\">fairly large number of gems</a>, including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, and NMatrix.</p>\n<p>NMatrix <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zSycrJ\" target=\"_blank\">has been awarded grants</a> by the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Association</a> in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/GTm7qh\" target=\"_blank\">Statsample</a> and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while <a href=\"https://goo.gl/DLioLK\" target=\"_blank\">daru</a>, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/pFyO7v\" target=\"_blank\">nyaplot</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/2ttLvk\" target=\"_blank\">gnuplotrb</a> take care of data analysis and visualization.

Others, like minimization, integration and nmatrix, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects.</p>\n<p>Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. Further, since we are a science-related project, we expect that successful student projects could lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.</p>\n",

There is also a large pool of capable and motivated contributors. The first mission of the Scala Center is to consult with the user community, define common goals, and organize contributions and its own resources to achieve these goals.\nThe Scala Center is a designated unit at EPFL, independent from the Scala research group (LAMP).</p>\n<h3>The Scala Language</h3>\n<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\nScala is the technology of choice for a vibrant open-source ecosystem, including popular platforms and frameworks such as Spark, Kafka, Akka, Finagle, Cats, and Play, to name just a few.</p>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n",

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description_html": "<h5>Our Journey</h5>\n\n<p>SeaQL.org was founded back in 2020. In the past three years, we developed and maintained several popular Rust libraries: SeaORM, SeaQuery, and Seaography. Each library is designed to fill a niche in the Rust ecosystem, and they are made to play well with other Rust libraries.</p>\n\n<p>We're thrilled with the adoption by the Rust community. At the end of 2023, we have accumulated 8,000 GitHub stars across our projects and accumulated 5 million total downloads on crates.io. Many startups and companies are building their products using SeaQL libraries.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Our Mission</h5>\n<p>We develop tools that enable developers to build applications in Rust. We want to drive Rust adoption in industry and universities.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Our Vision</h5>\n<p>We believe software can be fast, robust, and versatile. We want to develop and promote software engineering tools and techniques that would improve the productivity of engineers and quality of software.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Our Commitment</h5>\n<p>We are committed to nurturing the next generation of open source developers by offering internship experience tailored for university students - Seaography is one of the projects developed by interns under SeaQL.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h5>Our Projects</h5>\n* <a href=\"https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/\" target=\"_blank\">SeaORM 🐚</a> An async & dynamic ORM for Rust\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query\" target=\"_blank\">SeaQuery 🔱</a> A dynamic SQL query builder\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/SeaQL/seaography\" target=\"_blank\">Seaography 🧭</a> A GraphQL framework for SeaORM\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaStreamer/\" target=\"_blank\">SeaStreamer 🌊</a> A real-time stream processing toolkit\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firedbg.sea-ql.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FireDBG🔥</a> Time Travel Visual Debugger for Rust\n<br/>",

    "description_html": "<p>Soletta Project is a framework for making IoT devices. With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.</p>\n<p>Portable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Zephyr OS</li>\n<li>RIOT OS</li>\n<li>(Partially) Contiki OS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.</p>\n<p>The connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.</p>\n<p>For those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.</p>\n<p>Besides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.</p>\n",

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.</p>\n<p>Execution</p>\n<p>Development of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.</p>\n<p>The SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site. Most of that is embodied in the spec itself, but we have developed a number of separate assets that complement the specification, including a standard license list, implementation guidelines and the SPDX compatible tools.</p>\n",

Hardware development is beginning to slow, and the free lunch is almost over.  In this climate, it is more important now than ever to rethink our traditional approaches to parallel computation.  New solutions must be developed with the scalability of applications being central to their design.</p>\n<p>The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.  Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. The HPX runtime system is stirring up the pot by providing a modern implementation of all C++ standard facilities related to parallelism and concurrency, extended for the distributed use case.  HPX is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  For more information about HPX please see <a href=\"https://hpx.stellar-group.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. As you can see from our <a href=\"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-%28GSoC%29-2021\" target=\"_blank\">ideas page</a>, there are more possible projects for yourself to be involved with -- be creative!</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently, HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.</p>\n",

Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded.

We believe this will dramatically broaden the outreach of FPGA platforms and lower entry barriers into FPGA development for both professional engineers and hobbyists.</p>\n<p>FPGAs are an exciting and versatile development platform that can be used for addressing a variety of complex tasks, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>flexible parallel I/O</li>\n<li>low-latency machine learning</li>\n<li>robotics and motor control</li>\n<li>camera interfacing and ISP</li>\n<li>hardware glue logic</li>\n<li>general hardware-accelerated parallel processing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A big roadblock to what we believe should be much wider adoption are the specific tools that need to be learned on a per-vendor basis and their proprietary licensing.</p>\n<p>By working to implement a <strong>vendor neutral</strong> and <strong>modular</strong> flow that is <strong>easy to integrate</strong> with various types of other tools, and provides an open source, transparent development experience, SymbiFlow is meant to dramatically accelerate software-driven innovation in FPGA development.</p>\n<p>SymbiFlow is already enabling new tools, development platforms and communities that build around the end-to-end open flow - and has made significant progress throughout the last few years. But a lot of work is still needed before it becomes a standard like GCC in the software world.</p>\n<p>SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which deals with creating so-called <a href=\"https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs\" target=\"_blank\">FPGA \"architecture definitions\"</a>, i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.</p>\n<p>Those definitions serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys. QuickLogic’s FPGAs are supported in direct collaboration with the vendor themselves, while support for other vendors is provided within separate collaborating projects targeting different FPGAs - <a href=\"https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjxray\" target=\"_blank\">Project X-Ray</a> for Xilinx 7-Series, <a href=\"https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm\" target=\"_blank\">Project IceStorm</a> for Lattice iCE40, <a href=\"https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis\" target=\"_blank\">Project Trellis</a> for Lattice ECP5 and <a href=\"https://github.com/gatecat/prjoxide\" target=\"_blank\">Project Oxide</a> for Lattice CrossLink NX FPGAs.</p>\n",

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplify complex log data</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.</p>\n<p><strong>Databases destinations</strong></p>\n<p>If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.</p>\n<p><strong>Message queue support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<p><strong>HTTP/REST support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively</p>\n<p><strong>Support language bindings</strong></p>\n<p>Want to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.</p>\n",

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\n\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).

    "description_html": "<p>TARDIS is a tool that creates synthetic observations (spectra) for exploding stars (supernovae). \nA supernova marks the brilliant death throes of a star, during which it outshines its entire galaxy. It not only marks death, though: supernova ejecta change the evolution of the Universe and enable the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae return heavy elements assembled from the primordial hydrogen and helium left after the Big Bang.\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations, by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and allowing to compare them to observations.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy,  computer science, statistics and modern software design in building a tool that is both useful in research and teaching alike (with a documentation that would in theory allow anyone to recreate it from scratch).</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>ENIGMA comprises three principal components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An integrated development environment</strong> meant to help users organize their game's assets and logic in a way that is free of boilerplate and easy to reason about.</li>\n<li><strong>A compiler</strong> that builds these game files into executable code, with generated asset management boilerplate (among other game engine basics).</li>\n<li><strong>An engine</strong> that integrates with the user's built game to drive the core logic and tie everything together.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ENIGMA is meant to be simple to learn and even simpler to work with. ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.</p>\n<p>Users write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.</p>\n<p>The compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.</p>\n<p>To really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.</p>\n",

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 5 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD Project began 28 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

With over 45 international chapters, 250 members and over 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.</p>\n<p>Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:</p>\n<p>Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals &amp; organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.</p>\n<p>Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed.

    "description_html": "<p>Julia is a fast and flexible language for technical computing. While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.</p>\n<p>Julia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different! If that sounds interesting to you, please do send an application, or reach out to us at julia-users@googlegroups.com with any questions.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Because each disease is different, there are significant challenges in obtaining enough information relevant to the patient’s condition to help inform diagnosis and treatment.  The PXF standard will allow phenotypic data to be captured at the point of publication, to be transmitted in the context of diagnostic testing, to be used for exchange of data in clinical studies, and as a backbone for patient-contributed data registries and social media. Increasing the volume of computable phenotype data across a diversity of systems will support large-scale computational disease analysis using cross species genotype and phenotype data.</p>\n<p>The initial version of the PXF standard is being implemented in the context of journals, but an editing tool to read and write PXF documents is needed to facilitate this exchange. This project can include one or more of the following tasks, depending on the status of the project at the start of the program and an agreement between the student and the mentor:</p>\n<p>Add import and export of PXF files to the Monarch WebPhenote application.\nCreate a lightweight web application that can be integrated into other research portals and platforms to ease the creation of PXF files and enable their distribution.\nImplement tools to convert variant descriptions in other formats to PXF format. This includes the parsing of plain text, HTML and more structured formats. The PXF output from this will then be reviewable and editable by a users prior to committing the PXF.</p>\n<p>Candidates should have a good understanding of software tools such as Unix (MacOSX or Linux); Git; one or more high-level programming languages (NodeJS, Python, Go, Ruby); and a basic understanding of network usage (HTTP, SSH). Ability to write simple web applications (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) is important.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-format/wiki/Overview-of-Phenotype-Exchange-Format\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-format/wiki/Overview-of-Phenotype-Exchange-Format</a></p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Are you interested in contributing to a widely-used performance evaluation tool for computer networking research? <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org\" target=\"_blank\">ns-3</a> is a <em>discrete-event, packet-level network simulator</em> with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>The Palisadoes Foundation’s open-source software projects support community groups organize their daily activities. A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed. \nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\nWe have had many open-source projects. For the past three years we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities. \nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site hosted service like WordPress as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills. We hope that our GSoC students will help us achieve this goal in 2021.</p>\n",

We've been working for years on educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more</p>\n<p>Our contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers</p>\n<h4>Our Games</h4>\n<p><em>Terasology</em> is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p><em>Destination Sol</em> is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h4>Architecture</h4>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n<h4>Codeuino</h4>\n<p>For GSOC 2020 we're supporting <a href=\"http://codeuino.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://codeuino.org</a> to let them offer project ideas through us.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.\nThe goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.\nThis goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. \nTools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.</p>\n",

New ideas about how to analyze astronomy data has started what is now called “the spectral-timing revolution” leading to a hotbed of new developments.</p>\n<p>One of the obstacles of the several fast-moving research groups in this field is the lack of shared, publicly available tools for analysis. Many individual tools and libraries exist, and some are even publicly available, but what is lacking is a coherent set for a complete analysis. Moreover, the lack of any GUI makes the tools (more) difficult to use. This situation hinders collaboration and mobility of researchers between groups. Most importantly, it is an entrance barrier that forbids other researchers and students to join the field and build momentum in this exciting period of new discoveries.</p>\n<p>We will build a timing analysis framework, integrating and expanding our Python projects for specialized astronomy tools Stingray and MaLTPyNT, also making use of existing tools like Astropy, Sherpa, SciPy and Carma.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>TLA stands for the Temporal Logic of Actions, but it has become a shorthand for referring to the TLA+ specification language and the PlusCal algorithm language, together with their associated tools.</p>\n<p>TLA+ is based on the idea that the best way to describe things formally is with simple mathematics, and that a specification language should contain as little as possible beyond what is needed to write simple mathematics precisely. TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.</p>\n<p>PlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language. However, a PlusCal expression can be any TLA+ expression, which means anything that can be expressed with mathematics. This makes PlusCal much more expressive than any (real or toy) programming language. A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.</p>\n<p>The principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment). Go to the TLA home page to find out more about TLA.</p>\n",

Companies are developing applications designed to work in the cloud (<em>cloud native</em>), but are finding that there isn't a single cloud offering that meets all of their requirements. Combinations of private and public clouds (<em>hybrid multicloud</em>) are necessary to deliver the services required for their business needs.</p>\n<p>Maintaining the communication between all of these clouds (the <em>network fabric</em>) can be complicated. Each one can have its own APIs and policies. Making sure everything stays up to date and secure is time consuming and error prone.</p>\n<p>That's where we come in.</p>\n<h4>One (Tungsten) Fabric</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://tungsten.io\" target=\"_blank\">Tungsten Fabric</a> is a secure software defined networking project designed for the cloud native, multicloud environment.

Beginning in 2022, we took over the programmatic responsibilities of the UCSC Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS), including mentorship activities such as GSoC. Following in line with the earlier work of CROSS, the OSPO creates partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the UC system in order to help students learn from open source communities, support scientists in using open source to accelerate research efforts, and connect students and scientists with sponsors from industry, government, and foundations. The OSPO helps bridge the gap between academic research and successful open source projects by promoting innovative projects maintained by UC-affiliated scientists and researchers. We support the transfer of cutting-edge technology resulting from UC-originating research to industry via successful open source projects. Due to the multi-campus nature of our current efforts, the projects we support and promote cover a wide range of topics and technologies - including:\n\n- Open Source Hardware and Chip Design\n- AI / Machine Learning\n- Storage Systems and Devices\n- Data Science and visualization\n- Performance analysis\n- Reproducibility\n- Cloud-based computation\nAll of our mentors are scientists and researchers who are actively involved in one or more of these open source projects.",

    "description_html": "<p>UCSC Xena helps biologists, both with and without computation skills, to visualize and analyze cancer genomics datasets. Our web-based data browser enables cancer researchers around the world to discover trends and test their hypotheses. Unique in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to easily view both large public resources generated by consortium around the world AND their own data or data from a publication. We accomplish this using a decoupled server-client architecture, where data is distributed across both public and private servers while being securely combined and visualized in one web-based browser.</p>\n<p>While we are funded nationally by NCI, our users are international, with only ~40% of our traffic coming from the United States. We are committed to open-source software and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our static interval tree[<a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree\" target=\"_blank\">http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree</a>] and KM statistics[<a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier\" target=\"_blank\">http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier</a>]).</p>\n<p>Students we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger UCSC Genomics Institute[<a href=\"https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</a>], whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease.</p>\n<p>We aim to ensure that our students gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and code to the project. We are committed to putting the code from students out to production and into the world where it is used by real cancer researchers. In addition, we are always looking for long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genomics, statistics, data visualization, or functional programing, let us know! No prior knowledge of cancer or biology required.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p><strong>Unitex/GramLab</strong> is a corpus processing suite for the analysis of texts in natural language by using language resources and tools. These resources consist of language-processing dictionaries and grammars provided by contributors from several countries. Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.</p>\n<p>The dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called <a href=\"http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=7\" target=\"_blank\">DELA</a>, internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.</p>\n<p>The grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata. They are represented as graphs that the user can easily create and update using a visual integrated development environment which is an essential part of the platform.</p>\n",

It began as a student driven university project at Ecole Centrale Paris in 1996.</p>\n<p>Since 2001, VLC developed steadily from a GNU/Linux-only network stream player to a fully fledged media player and streaming server architecture available for GNU/Linux, BSD, MS Windows, macOS, iOS, tvOS, Android and OS/2. We estimate an installed base on MS Windows of 320,000,000 copies along with 30,000,000 on OS X and uncountable copies on GNU/Linux and BSD. Recently, we crossed 3 billion downloads of all versions over the project life time.</p>\n<p>While we are a small team of about 12 people, our mission is to get VLC out to as many user as possible on virtually any platform. The whole VideoLAN community is around 25 people, all working in different projects, like VLC, dav1d, rav1e, x264 or VLMC.</p>\n",

ViSP was designed to be independent from the hardware, to be simple to use, expandable and cross-platform. ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.</p>\n<p>Releases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.</p>\n<p>The user site is at <a href=\"https://visp.inria.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://visp.inria.fr/</a>.

The software originates at the Databases and Information Systems (DBIS) research group of the University of Basel, Switzerland and has evolved into a thriving community involving people inside and outside of academia who’s common interest is multimedia retrieval.</p>\n<p>The vitrivr-stack and individual components thereof have won various awards over the years. The stack consists of three independent systems written in Java, Kotlin and Typescript:</p>\n<p>Cottontail DB: Is a column store that combines classical boolean retrieval and vector space retrieval used for multimedia search in a unified data and query model. It can be used as a standalone component independent of vitrivr and queries can be formulated through a gRPC API.</p>\n<p>Cineast: Is a feature extraction and query engine, that generates feature descriptors - often vectors - stores them in the database layer or uses them for lookup. Furthermore, Cineast fuses results generated by different feature modules to produce the final output. Cineast can be interacted with through REST as well as gRPC.</p>\n<p>vitrivr NG: Is our user-interface written in Angular / Typescript. It offers different means of query formulation, displays results and enables exploration of results and individual items.</p>\n<p>Together, these three components make up a self-contained system for an end-to-end multimedia retrieval experience. In addition to supporting various media types, the stack also offers support for different query modes such as Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, Text-based queries etc. The modular nature of the stack allows for easy extension on many different levels and integration with machine learning methods using completely different ecosystems.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p><strong>webpack is a module bundler</strong>. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.</p>\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n<p>Currently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).</p>\n<h4>What makes webpack unique?</h4>\n<p><strong>Extensibility</strong> webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Focused around Web Performance</strong> webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.</p>\n<p><strong>Built in JavaScript</strong> webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Used at Scale</strong> webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Owned</strong> webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling</p>\n",

It is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and educational institutions.</p>\n<p>It supports 2500+ protocols, and has been used to demonstrate security vulnerabilities, analyze performance issues, troubleshoot application issues, teach concepts, and more. It has been used as part of conformance tests for network protocols, and to develop the latest Internet standards.</p>\n<p>The core of Wireshark is written in C while the GUI is written is C++. Additional functionality may be implemented in Lua. Tests are written using pytest. Code is stored in Git and will be reviewed through Gerrit Code Review before acceptance. A CI system ensures that the quality of the codebase is maintained and third-party developers can also easily integrate with Travis CI, Gitlab, etc. Wireshark is a cross-platform application, available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other *nix platforms. Translations for the user interface are pulled from Transifex.</p>\n<p>Documentation references:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wireshark.org/docs/</a> - Mostly user documentation references.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/develop.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wireshark.org/develop.html</a> - Information for developers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/</a> - Wireshark Developer's Guide.</li>\n<li>In the source tree, there is also doc/README.developer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will have the opportunity to work with a talented and experienced development team and we will try to make arrangements so that they may attend Sharkfest, Wireshark's developer and user conference.</p>\n",

Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.</p>\n<p>Today, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers.

The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.</p>\n<h3>What is Zenodo?</h3>\n<p>Zenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at <a href=\"http://home.cern/\" target=\"_blank\">CERN</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.openaire.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAIRE</a>, sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public <a href=\"https://zenodo.org\" target=\"_blank\">service</a>, as well as Free and Open Source <a href=\"http://zenodo.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\">Software</a>, based on <a href=\"http://invenio.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\">Invenio</a> - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world!</p>\n<p>[1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus\" target=\"_blank\">Zenodotus</a>, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<p>Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other team chat tools designed to help teams (whether <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/\" target=\"_blank\">open source projects</a> or companies) collaborate effectively via its unique <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/why-zulip/\" target=\"_blank\">threading model</a>. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">much more</a> -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its <a href=\"http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html\" target=\"_blank\">extensive developer documentation</a> (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",

    "description_html": "<h4>What is ZynAddSubFX?</h4>\n<p>ZynAddSubFX is a cross platform synthesizer which provides a wide range of functionality to go from a basic oscillator to a full virtual musical instrument. A quick overview of some features includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polyphonic with support for legato and mono playing modes</li>\n<li>Three synthesizer engines:<ul>\n<li>Additive Synthesis for classic synth sounds composed of a variety of voices with powerful modulation. This exposes modulators ranging from LFOs and envelopes to oscillator modulators for FM, PM, and AM.</li>\n<li>Subtractive Synthesis for creating variable bandwidth harmonics from filtered white noise</li>\n<li>PAD synthesis for creating beautiful pads and other instruments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Powerful waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine harmonics</li>\n<li>A variety of filters including analogue modeled filters, formant filters, and state variable filters.</li>\n<li>Envelopes can have ADSR (or ASR, etc..) modes or can be free modes (with any shape)</li>\n<li>Effects for Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phasing, Wave-shaping, Equalizing, Dynamic Filtering with flexible signal routing</li>\n<li>A custom Ruby based window toolkit for optimal embeddability and scriptability</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What makes ZynAddSubFX different?</h4>\n<p>Compared to other audio synthesis applications ZynAddSubFX offers a large number of simple building blocks in a mostly fixed signal routing. Each component on it's own is easy to understand, but once all the components interact, then new sounds can emerge and interesting modulation possibilities open up. Overall there are millions of parameters which can be manipulated from the user interface or via the open sound control API. With the collection of building blocks provided to users a powerful sound design tool is provided along with an interesting variety of development challenges. The challenges range from workflow issues, to signal processing trade-offs, to user interface refinements, and more.</p>\n",
